Our mind and body are made of the food \\nwe eat and it continues until we live. The body parts, organs, muscles, blood and bones are all made from the food we have \\neaten. Food gives energy and stamina for work. It also gives emotional stability and security. Our appearance and feeling of \\ngood health and happiness also depends on the right kind  of food and the quantity of food that we eat. Lot of research is \\nbeing done and new findings published every day to  increase our knowledge about food and nutrition, and to find ways to \\napply this knowledge in choosing the right foods to eat, so that our body is well nourished and healthy. \\n1.2   DEFINITION OF FOOD, NUTRITION, NUTRIENTS and DIET \\nFood is the very basis of our life . It contains different nutrients that are needed by the body for survival and sustenance. \\nThe food we eat  is digested and converted into nutrients. These nutrients are absorbed and transported to different parts \\nof the body, and utilized for the day -to-day functioning. A t the end they are disposed of by further metabolism and \\ntransformed into the end products. We need to consume a variety of foods in order to remain healthy. \\nThus, we can define food as any solid or liquid which when eaten can supply any of the following: \\n\\uf0b7 Material from which the body can produce movement, heat or other forms of energy, \\n\\uf0b7 Material for growth, repair and reproduction, \\n\\uf0b7 Substances necessary to regulate the production of energy or the processes of growth and repair.'),\n",

In other words nutrients are vital in keeping a \\nliving thing alive and helping it to grow. \\nThe diet consists of those foods or mixtures of foods in the amounts which are eaten daily. A good diet provides adequate \\namounts of all the nutrients, without harmful excesses, from a wide range of foods.  Dietary habits are dependent on \\ngeographical and cultural traits and vary accordingly. \\nNutrition is the process by which living things receive the food necessary for them to be healthy. The science of nutrition is \\na study of all the processes of growth, maintenance and repair of the living body which depend upon the digestion and \\nabsorption of food and the study of that food. \\nA nutritionist is an expert on the relationship between food and health and a  dietitian is an expert on what one should eat \\nunder different conditions. \\n1.3 FUNCTIONS OF FOOD \\nLet us now get acquainted with the major functions of food. As we know we eat when we are hungry, but foo d not only \\nremoves hunger, it also gives us a feeling of satisfaction and renewed strength.  We also share food to express happiness, \\nfriendship, love and unity. Most families bond over mealtimes. Most meetings and important discussio ns in companies \\nhappen over lunches and dinners. Thus, food has many important functions in our lives. When we understand t hese \\nfunctions, we appreciate how they affect our food intake and our physical and mental well-being. \\n1.3.1  Physiological functions \\n The most important function of food is to build our body. We have seen that we probably weighed somewhere between 2.5 \\nto 3.2 kg at birth and now weigh between 45 to 60 kg. This growth is the  result of the food we ate from birth to adulthood. \\nNow as an adult, our weight is constant which shows that we have achieved optimum growth. At this stage, the food we eat \\nhelps to maintain and renew worn out cells of our body and keep the body in good condition. \\nSecondly, food provides the energy, our body needs for all its activities, voluntary and involuntary . We know that even \\nwhen we sleep, many of our body's activities continue, like breathing, heartbeat, digestion, absorption of food, etc. These \\nkeep us alive without any effort on our part and are called involuntary activities. \\nThe work or activities we do when we are awake and our mind is in it like studying, walking, cooking or working at the desk, \\nor playing a game of badminton, is called voluntary activity. The amount of energy  we need for all these depends on the \\nkind of activity and the time and energy we spend doing it. \\nThe third function of foo d is to regulate all the activities of the body and protect it  from diseases and infections. Examples \\nof some of the activities which regulate the body are given below: \\n\\uf0b7 Beating of our heart for circulation of blood  \\n\\uf0b7 Maintenance of our body temperature \\n\\uf0b7 Muscle contraction for voluntary and involuntary movements \\n\\uf0b7 Removal of waste from the body in form of sweat, urine and feces, etc. \\nApart from these , vital nutrients in food also help  to protect the body  from various infections , diseases and from \\nwearing out. \\n  1.3.2  Psychological functions \\nIn addition, to meeting our physical needs, food also satisfies certain emotional needs. These include a feeling of security, \\nlove and attention. We feel secure when familiar foods are served  which are also known as comfort f oods. When a child \\ncomes home from school the mother knows that he/ she is hungry and serves food. Thus, she expresses her  love and \\nattention. Many times, we miss our mother because of the attachment to her cooking.\"),\n",

If we are amongst friends, we try \\nunfamiliar foods and enlarge our food experience. These are some of the positive aspects of food  acceptance. There are \\noccasions when we are hungry, but are unable to eat even a nutritious  meal, because the foods are unfamiliar or we are \\nunhappy or lonely. We need to understand these aspects about food acceptance, so that when we plan meals, we will not \\nonly think of nutrition, but also the persons for whom we plan. \\n1.3.3  Socio-cultural Functions \\nWe know how important food is in our social and cultural life. We serve refreshments at meetings and seminars or to \\nvisitors to create a relaxed atmosphere  for an exchange of ideas. In most of our  festivals and celebrations we have lunch \\nand dinner with family and friends which binds us together. Food is also used as an expression of happiness. For example, \\nwe distribute sweets when we pass examinations, buy a car or when there is a marriage feast. We also celebrate birthdays, \\nanniversaries, promotions etc. by cutting cakes and enjoying food at parties. In religious functions like Easter, Ramzan, Rajo, \\nNuakhai, etc. we make special preparations to distribute food offerings . Thus , food helps to strengthen our social and \\ncultural ties.  \\n1.3.4 Food Habits \\nFood intake is related to food habits, which is a powerful force in deciding what we eat. We tend to eat according to our set \\nfood habits and like all habits these may be good or bad. For mation of food habits have to be understood so that we can \\ntake appropriate measures towards building good food habits. \\n\\uf0b7 Regional and Community Variations: Food habits are affected by food production and supply. For example, rice is the \\nstaple food in the East, West and South of India  whereas wheat is popular  in the North.  This is because of agricultural \\npractices of the region. Then the amounts and kinds of foods we eat depend on  the money that one can spend.  The \\ngeographic region, religion, community and family beliefs and practices that have developed over several generations, \\nheavily influences a family’s eating pattern. \\nInspite of all th ese variations, all regional patterns can meet the nutritional needs of people if sufficient food from each \\ngroup is i ncluded. A particular food chosen and the way it is prepared and seasoned is a matter of personal ch oice. Social \\ncustoms like when and with whom and what to eat, will affect our exposure and hence our acceptance pattern. \\n\\uf0b7 Personal Factors: The atmosphere in  which we eat may modify our attitude towards food . A happy or an unhappy \\natmosphere affects our reactions to food and eating. Everyone has a personal response to the taste of foods. We may like \\npungent foods or acid foods while our friends may prefer mild  or astringent foods. These basic influences affect our food \\nhabits, as we tend to adopt the food practices of our family. Our selection of foods should be based on the knowledge of \\nfood values. Convenience of food preparation also affects food habits of the present generation. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Other Factors : Many other influences modify our food habits. When we move away from our region for education or work, \\nwe are exposed to new foods and our eating pattern is modified. Travelling within our food region and outside also \\ninfluences our food habits. Media also has a large role to play in food choices today. Though food habits are affec ted by \\nmany influences, individual food intake is dependent on personal preferences that are an important factor in deciding our \\nnutritional status. \\nThe best time to develop good and healthy food habits is in childhood. As f ood habits are closely associated with sense of \\nsecurity, so any modification, particularly in the adult stage, will require a strong motivation.  \\nWe know that energy need decreases with age hence modification in food habits need to be made to reduce energy in take \\nas people grow  older. When we see old people who are overweight,  we can see  that they have not made the  required \\nadjustment. We also s ee many  people, who are not overweight, but eat foods  that do not meet their need for other \\nnutrients, except calories. It is difficult for such  people to see the need for change because they maintain their weight and \\ndo not associate any symptoms of poor health they may have due to their eating habits. Generally, cause and effect are not \\neasily noted.'),\n",

We will need to understand the background of \\ntheir food habits before we can help them to improve or change their diet. The desire for good health is universal. It can be \\nused as a motivating force to help others. \\n1.3.5 Food misinformation \\nWe spend a considerable part of our time and income to select and purchase foods. Besides food habits, our choices are \\nalso affected by prevalent misconceptions, we have about foods and food products. We are exposed to a variety of views \\nabout the foods and their nutritional  contribution--through conversation, and through newspapers, magazines and books.  \\nPeople see and hear advertisements about foods and drinks. So their ideas about food are indirectly modified by what they \\nhear and see. The internet, television and other multimedia sources also influence food habits to a great extent. \\nWater: Some people think drinking water can help them lose weight  but water cannot wash away the fat from the cells, or \\nthose extra calories we get from overeating. If we drink water instead of the calorie-rich soft drinks, we might cut down on \\nour calorie intake. When a person or a child suffers from diarrhea and vomiting, some people restrict their water intake \\nwith the hope of stopping it, which is very wrong. W e know it is very important to feed clean, boile d, cooled water, with \\nadded sugar, salt and lemon, to a person who has suffered loss of body fluids due to diarrhea or vom iting. Water intake in \\nsuch a condition is crucial to prevent dehydration especially in children. \\nCereal and cereal products: There is a wrong notion that starchy foods, such as rice and bread, are high in calories. Many \\ndieters frequently reduce or cut out cereals from their diet. We need to remind them that basic cere als and plain breads \\n(like chapatti) are not very high in calories. T he calories come from the foods they add such as ghee, butter, cheese, jam, \\nsugar, oil, chutney, etc. It is the extra calorie foods that they should omit, not the breads and cereals.  \\nAnother misconception is that weight reduction is possible if we eat bread or chapati instead of rice. Actually, both rice and \\nwheat contain about the same number of calories. It is the total calorie intake that needs to be red uced not calories from a \\nparticular food.  \\nWe have noticed that many people cut the sugar fro m tea or coffee to reduce their calorie intake but do not skip the \\nbiscuits, cake, or other snacks that are served with the tea or coffee. The teaspoon of sugar they skip is only 20calories, and \\nthe snacks they eat may add 50- 100 'calories. So they end up having 2 to 5 times the calories than sugar. \\nFats and oils: All vegetable oils (except coconut and olive oil) contain a high amount of PUFA (poly unsaturated fatty acids). \\nIt is important to understand that vegetable oils do not contain any cholesterol. T o say that a particular brand of vegetable \\noil contains no cholesterol is intended to misguide us to think that other brands of vegetable oils contain cholesterol. The \\nnature of the oil of fat (unsaturated or saturated, fatty acid content, cholesterol cont ent, etc.) is not to be confused with \\ntheir calorie value. We know that  all oils, ghee and vanaspati provide the same calories i.e. nine calories per gram. \\nTherefore, we realize that when there is an advertisement of oil that contains less or low calories, we must know that it is \\nnot true. \\nOther foods and food products : Weaning food products are advertised as 'Doctors recommend' or 'more nourishing food \\nfor growth'. The fact is that there is nothing special about these pr oducts. Most of these are made from the cereals we use \\nat home, to which they add some milk powder, sugar, minerals and vitamins.  \\nSome brand of biscuits claim they are the best food for children. Actually , most biscuits are made from maida (refined \\nwheat flour), with the addition of varying amounts of fat and sugar. Thus, biscuits have lot of calories. When we feed \\nchildren with these instead of a meal, it does not provide the child with all the nutrients it needs. \\nAnother group of products advocated is a variety of synthetic drinks and carbonated beverages.  These contain only sugar, \\nflavor, color and acid and provide only energy. A few may have a little vitamin C, and nothing else. When these are taken \\nwith fast food and junk food they create health hazard s in the long run. Instead, if we make traditional cool drinks at home \\nand other snacks and food items it will cost a fraction of the price we pay for commercial weaning foods and c hildren’s \\nsnacks and drinks. Another advantage would be that children would develop healthy food habits in this way, which will help \\nthem through the lifetime.\"),\n",

For that \\nfirst, we need to review the nutritional components of the foods that we eat. The following paragraph will focus on this \\naspect. \\n 1.4.1 Classification of nutrients \\nAll foods are classified into three broad categories:- \\n\\uf0b7 Energy yielding foods (Carbohydrates and Fats) \\n\\uf0b7 Body building foods (proteins) \\n\\uf0b7 Protective  and  regulatory foods (vitamins, minerals and other foods) \\n1.4.2 Types of nutrients \\nThe foods that we consume are composed of varying quantities of the following nutritionally important components: \\n1)  Carbohydrates \\n2)  Proteins \\n3)  Lipids \\n4)  Water \\n5)  Minerals \\n6)  Vitamins \\n7)  Fibre \\n8)  Phytochemicals and anti-oxidants \\n9)  Detoxifying agents \\nIf these nutritional components are consumed daily in the amounts and proportion required, then the chances are that we \\nwill maintain a good health. \\n1.4.3 Functions of nutrients \\nWe use foods such as wheat, rice, dal, vegetables, fruits, milk, eggs, fish, meat, sugar, oils, on a daily basis in our diet. These \\nfoods are made up of the nutrients mentioned earlier. Let us get to know the functions of these nutrients in our body.  \\nCarbohydrates: We get about 70-80 per cent of our energy from carbohydrates. The energy content of foods is expressed \\nin calories. One gram of carbohydrate provides four calories. If we take these in excess of our body 's need, the unused part \\nis stored as glycogen in the muscle or converted to fat and stored for later use. The main carbohydr ates in our diet are \\nstarches found in cereals, dals and tubers, sugar from sugarcane and fruits. Cereals and dals also p rovide a large part of the \\nproteins, some minerals and vitamins. \\nProteins: As we know, proteins are present in all living tissues -both plant and animal. Next to water, protein is the most \\nabundant component of our body. About one-sixth our body weight is protein. The mai n function of protein is building of \\nnew tissues, and maintenance and repair of those already built. Further, a number of regulatory and protective substances \\n(enzymes, antibodies, hormones) in the body are made from proteins.  \\nWe get about 8 to 15 per cen t of our total energy from proteins. Energy supply is thus a secondary function of our dietary \\nproteins. Each gram of protein gives four calories of energy to our body. Protein is present in vege tables and animal \\nsources. Among the former, pulses, nuts and soybeans are good sources of protein. Among the latter, milk, fish, egg, meat, \\nchicken and liver are rich sources. Paneer and khoa (condensed milk) are also good sources of protein. \\nFats: In India, about 10 to 30 per cent of the energy needs are met from oils and fats. One gram of oil or fat gives nine \\ncalories of energy to the body. Please remember that the fats and oils are concentrated sources of e nergy. We need fats as \\na medium for the absorption of fat- soluble vitamins. We need essential fatty acids, which vegetable oils provide. The oil we \\nuse in seasoning, the ghee or butter used as a spread, and the fat in eggs and meat, are the major s ources of fats in our\"),\n",

The oilseeds and nuts we use in food preparations also contribute some fat. Remember i f we take more energy than \\nour body needs, in any form, be it fats, carbohydrates 'or proteins, it is stored in our body as fat. \\nMinerals: Our bones and teeth need minerals for their formation and maintenance. Iron is needed for formation of the red \\npigment in the blood. Minerals have an important role in the regulation of a number of body processe s, e.g. muscle \\ncontraction, nerve stimulation, respiration, etc. we get the minerals that we need from a variety of  foods. For example, we \\nget calcium from milk and leafy vegetables, iron from leafy vegetables, dals and eggs, sodium from salt and other foods. \\nVitamins: We need different vitamins, for example, vitamin A, B -complex, C, D, etc. Our body needs these to grow and \\ndevelop, to help our eyes, nerves a nd skin to remain healthy, and to protect us from infections. We need very small \\namounts of these vitamins. We get these from a variety of foods like leafy vegetables, carrots, amla , guava, masumbi, \\noranges, pulses, whole grain cereals and eggs. \\nWater: Our body contains approximately 60 to 65 per cent water. Hence, it is an essential part of our body structure. We \\nknow, water is a universal solvent. It carries food into the body, helps in the digestion and absorp tion of food and ensures \\nelimination of waste from the body. Water helps to regulate body temperature. It acts as a lubricant in the mobile parts of \\nour body, such as joints and prevents friction. We need about 5 to 6 glasses of water each day. We get it from the water we \\ndrink and beverages such as tea, coffee, etc. \\n1.4.4 Assimilation of food in the body \\nWe learnt about all the nutrients that the body needs. What we eat becomes flesh and blood. The process by which the  \\nnature of food is changed in the body is called digestion. The digestive tract is nature's (or our body's) ingenious way of \\nextracting nutrients from the food we eat. The digestive tract is selective. It breaks down th e materials that are nutritious \\nfor the body into particles that we can assimilate. Those particles that are left undigested pass out  from the other end of \\nthe digestive tract.  \\nOur body needs energy to perform its various activities, protein to replace the cells it has lost and to grow, various vitamins \\nand minerals for bone and blood formation and for the body to work efficiently and smoothly. \\nThe digestive system: \\nWhen the body requires food, it signals us to eat. This signal is hunger. The moment we eat something the digestive journey \\nstarts. As we swallow, the food slides across the gullet  or esophagus passing over the entrance to our lungs. Whenever we \\nswallow, the body automatically closes off all air passages, so that we do not choke. When we chew food, we break it up \\n(grind it) into small particles with our teeth.  \\nFrom the mouth, the food goes into the stomach, where it stay s for a few hours. The stomach  breaks the food into still \\nsmaller particles, mixing it at the same time with acid and  the enzyme pepsin, which chemically alters the protein in the \\nfood. From the stomach, the food enters the intestines. \\n We have a small intestine and a large  intestine. The small intestine is actually not small at all. It is actually a 20 feet coiled \\ntube within the abdomen. From here, food enters the large intestine. In the colon (latter portion of the large intestine), the \\nbody withdraws water, leaving behind semi -solid waste. The waste is held back here  because of the strong muscles ( called \\nsphincter muscles) of the rectum. It would be inconvenient and embarrassing if one had to excrete continuously. When the \\nbody chooses to defecate, this muscle is relaxed and the waste material is voided. \\nThe path that food follows in the body is like this: \\nMouth (epiglottis)\\uf0e0 Gullet (esophagus) \\uf0e0 Stomach\\uf0e0 Small intestine \\uf0e0 Large intestine \\uf0e0Rectum (anus). \\n\\uf0b7 For food to pass smoothly through the system, it must be mixed with water. If we drink too little water, the food \\nbecomes compact and moves very slowly. \\n\\uf0b7  For digestive enzymes to work on food, it should be finely divided and suspended in water so that every particle is \\naccessible to the enzymes. Once digestion is  complete and all the essential nutrients are absorbed, the  residue \\nwhich remains is excreted. It would be wasteful and inconvenient to excrete large amounts of water  with this\"),\n",

So your body withdraws some water, leaving a semi-solid mass just smooth enough and easy to pass. This \\nshows that food is altered physically in the digestive tract. \\n\\uf0b7 The enzymes of the digestive tract break down or digest carbohydrates, protein and fat into smaller units. This is \\nchemical alteration of food. \\nThe body needs many nutrients, which it absorbs from food through the digestive  tract. The digestive tract dige sts only \\ncarbohydrates, fats and proteins although  the food we eat contains many other  substances like vitamins, minerals,  \\npreservatives, colors, etc. \\nCertain glands in the body contribute the digestive juices or enzymes .These are the salivary glands, gastric glands, the liver \\nand the pancreas. The enzymes from these glands break down proteins, fats and carbohydrates. \\nPhysical Alteration of Food: we chew or masticate food, and grind it. Chewing food helps to \\n(i) Increase the surface area of food,  \\n(ii) Break the cell walls of cells, releasing the nutrients.  \\nIn the mouth, the tongue helps to mix the food with saliva. In the  stomach, food is mixed and altered further by \\ncontraction and relaxation of stomach  muscles (known as peristalsis). Fat, we know, does not mix with water  but \\ncontraction and relaxation of the stomach muscles breaks up the fat into small  particles and disperses it in the watery \\nmedium or liquid in the stomach. This dispersion of fat in the liquid is called emulsification. \\nRefer to figure 1.4.4a for the digestive system \\n Digestion of food: \\nCarbohydrates, fats and proteins that are in the food are much too large to be of use to  the body. Before the body can use \\nthem, it has to break them down into units, which are small enough to be absorbed into the bloodstream. \\nOne of the commonest forms of carbohydrate in food is starch. Starch is made up of many small units called glucose. All \\ncarbohydrates must be broken down into small soluble units for utilization by the body. \\nDigestion of c arbohydrate starts when you begin chewing food. When we c hew some bread or  rice, we find it tastes \\nsweeter as we keep chewing. This is because saliva contains a starch-splitting enzyme called ptyalin mixes with the starch in \\nthe food . In the stomach, littl e break down of carbohydrate occurs. In the intestines, however, the  carbohydrate is \\ncompletely hydrolyzed to glucose.  \\nHydrolysis means break down of a large substance into smaller ones with the addition of water.  \\nJust like starch in the rice must be hydrolysed, so also the protein in the pulses. Protein digestion begins in the stomach due \\nto the action of the enzyme, pepsin. However, pepsin by itself does not complete the digestion. I n the small intestine, \\nprotein digestion is completed by other enzymes (proteases) which are secreted by the pancreas. \\nFat digestion occurs mainly in the small intestine. Bile from the gall bladder breaks the  fat into small particles. Thus, the \\nenzymes have more access to the fat to hydrolyze them. Fats are also hydrolyzed during digestion. Just like carbohydrate \\nand protein, digestion of fat takes place gradually, in stages. Digestion of any one carbohydrate, protein or fat is like starting \\nwith a large chain of beads and splitting this into pieces by removing one bead at a time. Not everything we eat needs to be \\ndigested, e.g., vitamins and minerals or simple sugars like glucose.  \\nHowever, many times, the minerals and vitamins are bound to the fat, protein or carbohydrate in your food. Thus for these \\nvitamins and minerals to be available for absorption, first they need to be separated from the complexes in which these are \\nfound in the food. Fat -soluble vitamins need to be dissolved in fat in order to be absorbed.  Before absorption, the other \\nnutrients are dissolved  in water. Therefore, water is essential for absorption of most nutrients.  Enzymes speed up \\nhydrolysis just like a mixer hastens the grinding of food into smaller units. For hydrolysis to occur, water is necessary..'),\n",

Fibre is one \\nsubstance in our diet that remains undigested. Fibre is present in fruits, vegetables, in the outer skin of cereal grains and \\npulses. Fibre has  the property of absorbing water and swelling . It is not digested; it only increases the bulk (amount) of \\nundigested material. In addition, it soaks up water like a sponge. As a result, if we eat sufficient  fibre everyday, we can \\nensure that the muscles of our intestines are stimulated and defecation occurs regularly and constipation can be prevented. \\nIn the large intestine, no new enzymes are produced and therefore no further digestion  takes place. The main task of the \\nlarge intestine is to remove excess water from the  undigested material. Remember that most of the break down stages in \\ndigestion involve hydrolysis and therefore need wate r. A lot of water passes into the large intestine. After  this water is \\nremoved. The undigested material is removed from the body or excreted through the anus. \\nAbsorption of nutrients: \\nAbsorption is the process by which the products of digestion pass out of the digestive tract  through the cells in the \\nintestinal wall, into the bloodstream. \\nMost nutrients are absorbed directly into our blood, which is then distributed to different parts of the body. Some nutrients \\nare absorbed in the stomach, for  example vitamin B 12. Minerals like calcium and iron are absorbed in the first  portion of \\nthe small intestine. Most end products of digestion of carbohydrates, fats and proteins are absorbed in the small intestine. \\nAbsorption of carbohydrates, fats and proteins takes place after they are hydrolyzed into their smallest units: Glucose, fatty \\nacids, and amino acids, respectively. \\nUtilization of nutrients: \\nAfter being absorbed in the s mall intestine, the smaller units of carbohydrates  (glucose), proteins (amino acids) and fats \\n(fatty acids) are carried to the various parts of the body through the  bloodstream. In the body cells, carbohydrates and fats \\nare broken down or burnt to produce energy in the form of heat. Carbohydrates that are in excess of the body\\'s needs  are \\nconverted into fat and are stored in the body. Proteins are used for building new cells  during periods of growth and for \\nrepairing old and worn out ones when growth is  complete. The smaller units of proteins, left over after completing this \\nfunction are converted to body fat. However, if the calories produced by the fats and carbohydrates are  not adequate for \\nthe body, proteins are also converted to energy. \\nRefer to figure no.1.4.4b for digestion and absorption of food. \\n1.5 NUTRITION \\nNutrition science is defined by Robinson  as: \\n\"The science of foods, nutrients and other substances therein; their action, interaction and balance in relation to health \\nand disease; the process by which an organism ingests, digests, absorbs, transports and utilizes nutrients and disposes off \\ntheir end products\". \\nThus, the entire gamut of what foods are needed for maintaining good health, how they are processed to provide us the \\nwherewith to carry out our daily activities, and how the end products of the foods we ingest  or eat  are eliminated \\nconstitute the science of nutrition. \\nThe body\\'s needs change through the various stages of the life cycle. It is necessary to know how to  meet these needs by \\nproper selection and intake of foods. A person\\'s growth rate and size is decided by two main factors, one’s inborn capacity \\nto grow and environmental conditions. Nutrition is one of the major environmental conditions because  if our genes decide \\nhow tall we should be then our nutrition decides whether we reach such height or not. \\n \\nNutrition affects our body size, our pe rformance and our longetivity and good and bad nutrition can be gauged from \\nassessment of these three parameters. \\nBody size means our height; weight and skin fold thickness (to measure fat and lean muscle). Measurement of height, \\nweight and skin fold thickness are broad parameters to know whether we are in tune with genetic inhe ritance and are well \\nnourished.'),\n",

As the brain is the fastest growing organ in the body, most of its \\ngrowth is over by the time a child is around two years old. So providing good nutrition to a pregnant and lactating mother, \\nan infant and a preschooler is very vital. After that age, it will be too late. Our ability to work is also an important aspect and \\nit totally depends on our nutrition. Underweight and malnourished individuals have physically weak b odies, low memory \\nand low immunity that often make them sick.  \\n \\nNutrition affects the longetivity of a person. Certain life threatening diseases like tuberculosis, anemia, and other childhood \\nailments increase mortality. Well-fed individuals are resistant to such diseases and live longer thus improving the country’s \\nhealth status and productivity. \\n \\nHence, nutrition is important from conception to old age for a disease free and long life. \\n \\n1.5.1 Normal nutrition \\nOur nutrition depends on many factors. Each one of us should have certain type of nutrition best suited for his or her body \\ntypes. Normal nutrition leads to good health. Good health has been defined as not only freedom from diseases but also a  \\nstate of complete physical, mental and spiritual well being. The requirements for good health are many and they are : \\n1. Optimal growth and development during childhood and adolescence  that leads to t he full expression of an \\nindividual's genetic potential.  Growth is defined in terms of physical features such as height and weight while \\ndevelopment includes all aspects of physical and mental development. \\n2. Maintaining structural and function al integrity of body  tissues throughout life that leads to an active and \\nproductive life. Exa mples include  moist, b right and sparkling eyes for good vision, s mooth and sof t skin that \\nprevents the entry of infections through the body surface, thus maintaining the integrity of internal organs like the \\ngastrointestinal tract and the liver for  proper digestion and assimilation of f oods and r emoval of toxic w aste \\nproducts. \\n3. Ability to perform mental tasks efficiently: Good nutrition is essential for children to develop cognitive skills, learn \\nschool-oriented tasks well, perform optimally,  and s tay on in school. Similarly good nutrition is impo rtant in \\nsustaining attention and memory in adults as well. \\n4. Ability to withstand the process of ageing with minimal disability. \\n5. Ability to combat diseases and resist infectio ns, and to minimize the effects  of environmental pollutants.  To \\nmaintain positive health, it is essenti al that we combine and consume a variety of  foods in such a way that the \\nnutrient needs for the above functions are all provided. \\nAlthough the principles of nutrition apply throughout the lifespan, greater emphasis is to provide enough food and care for \\nthe younger age groups. Young people from infancy through adolescence grow  continuously -- a characteristic that we  \\nadults do not share.  A child gets taller  and grows out of his clothes. Within two decades of life, a man  increases about 20 \\ntimes in weight and about 4 times in height (in comparison to his birth weight and height). Growth means increase in size of \\nthe body as well as development and maturation of the organs and systems of the body. Increase in size is visible externally \\nwhereas the development of organs and systems that takes place internally cannot be seen. \\nCritical periods of growth: \\nOur body grows in a set pattern with different tissues and parts of the body growing and maturing at different times. There \\nare three periods in a child's life, which  are critical because intensive growth occurs  here. Intensive growth includes \\ndevelopment of bones muscles and fat, development of other internal organs like brain, liver, kidney  and hormonal glands \\nand sexual maturation. If there is any adverse influence at these times; growth is affected and will slow down. \\nThe three periods are: \\n\\uf0b7 Prenatal period (nine months in the mother's womb) \\n\\uf0b7 First year of infancy \\n\\uf0b7 Adolescence (between 12 and 18 years) \\nWe can see the distinct differences in growth changes in both heights and weights of children in the following tables.\"),\n",

These will \\nbe taken up in detail in further units. \\nWe need to consume a variety of foods in order to remain healthy and that calls for a balanced diet.. A simple thumb rule is \\nto classify foods into  different food groups. The basic seven -food groups’ concept is useful in getting a balanced diet that \\nhelps us to remain healthy. These basic seven food groups are:  \\n1)  Cereals and cereal products  \\n2)  Pulses (also meat and meat products)  \\n3)  Milk and milk products  \\n4)  Vegetables and fruits  \\n5)  Nuts and oil seeds  \\n6)  Fats and oils, and  \\n7)  Sugars \\nAn easy way to understand the balanced consumption of these seven food groups is represented as four  steps to a healthy \\ndiet. Our daily diets for maintaining  good health should be made up of generous amounts of vege tables and fruits, \\nadequate amounts of cereals, pulses, milk and milk products, moderate amounts of meat and flesh food s and limited \\nquantities of fats and oils, nuts and oil seeds and sugars.  The figure below shows general dietary guidelines for Indians, \\nwhich provide a foundation to nutrition and health. \\nEAT SPARINGLY Fat, Oils & sugars \\nEAT MODERATELY Meat & flesh foods \\nEAT LIBERALLY Vegetable & Fruits \\nEAT ADEQUATELY CEREALS , PULSES, MILK \\n \\nRefer to table no.1.5.1c for the food pyramid \\n 1.5.2 Malnutrition \\nMalnutrition is a state of improper nutrition balance in the body. While some people eat less than w hat they need others \\nconsume too much. Inadequate intake of food or a specific nutrient le ads to under nutrition, while over nutrition means \\nthat a person eats more food than he/she needs. Both under nutrition and over nutrition are two mani festations of \\nmalnutrition. \\nUnder nutrition:  \\nUnder nutrition affects growth in children, their physical and intellectual capacity and work perfor mance as well as \\nresistance to infection. It may even determine how long a person lives. Food is vital to life. If a child does not have enough \\nfood, it wil l not grow as it should. Naturally, such a child will be smaller in stature. If the deprivation is in the first two or \\nthree years of life, the child's brain will not grow fully. In addition, bones will not harden and new bones will not form.  \\nAn individual’s capacity to work and perform depends on he or she being in the best state of health. Hungry children cannot \\nconcentrate on their studies. Lack of sufficient food may reduce the desire or motivation to work. Under nutrition, \\ntherefore, can compromise physical, intellectual and emotional performance. Deficiency of a single nutrient also has similar \\neffects. People who have inadequate food are generally thin and underweight. Food provides with substances that protect \\nus against disease. Undernourished pe ople will not be able to resist infection effectively. If we are ill , we do not feel like\"),\n",

The more severe the illness, the greater will be our lack of appetite and the less our food intake. At the same \\ntime our body needs more food in order t o combat infection. If we have diarrhea or worms, we will not be able to absorb \\nnutrients as we do normally. This will eventually lead to under nutrition and diseases. \\nOver nutrition and obesity: \\nOver nutrition is consumption of more food than we need. The most common problem of over nutrition is overweight and \\nobesity. When we consume more energy than we spend, i.e. more than we need, our body stores the extra energy as fat. \\nA comparison of weight is done with standard tables, which gives \"ideal\" weight according to height, age and sex. If weight \\nis more than 10 per cent above the \\'ideal\" weight, then the person is considered overweight and if it is 15 or 20 per cent \\nmore, then obese. Over nutrition and obese people tend to suffer from hypertension, stroke, diabetes, heart disease etc. \\nThey feel uneasy because of excess fat around their chest and tire easily. Fat people may also die at a young age. \\nReducing the amount of food so  that the energy intake is less than energy expenditure is t he best way to counter \\noverweight problems. One kg of fat in the body stores 7700 kcals. One can lose this extra kg of weight in two weeks by \\nconsuming 500 kcals less. These 500 kcals can be reduced by curtailing one\\'s intake of oily foods, sweets, starchy foods, and \\nif necessary, some cereals and dals. Such a person can be advised to have a well balanced diet  when he is trying to reduce \\nweight. One should also be advised to do some exercise and be active so that he increases his energy expenditure. \\nRefer to table no. 1.5.2a for weight for height for males (overweight & underweight limits) \\nRefer to table no. 1.5.2b for weight for height for females (overweight & underweight limits) \\nDetection of malnutrition: \\nApart from physical symptoms and diet asses sment, malnutrition has to  be assessed clinically before prescribing diet \\nchanges. \\nOne of the first steps in detecting malnutrition is to check the person’s diet. T his is then compared with the daily food \\nguide. This will show whether one is getting too little or too much of a particular food group. Next, the weight of the person \\nis compared with the standard available. If the person is slightly underweight it may not matter much, but if he is drastically \\nunderweight, it means that he is undernourished. Next simple physical check up of the person’s  mouth, skin, eyes, inner \\nlining of the eyelids, tongue and lower limbs is done. Lack of many nutrients affects these parts of the body. If the skin is \\nrough and scaly or if there are cracks at the corners of the mouth, cracks on the lips, bleeding gums, it could be due to lack \\nof several vitamins. If the inner lining of the eyelid is pale, the person could be anemic. All these changes occur because of \\ntaking insufficient food. \\n1.5.3           Nutritional status \\nNutritional status is the level of nourishment of our body. Each of us would like to have a good nutritional status. So far, we \\nhave learnt that nutrition affects our body size, our brain develo pment, our performance, our capacity to work and life \\nspan. Nutritional status shows the kind  of nourishment our b ody gets from the foods we eat.  If foods provide s for our  \\nbody\\'s needs optimally, we look and feel healthy and enjoy a good nutritional status. \\nIndicators of good nutritional status are: \\n1. Measurement of body size: \\nWe have learnt that body weight and height indicate our body size. In addition, the head, chest and mid arm \\ncircumferences give an idea of growth and development, especially of small children (0-5 years). Therefore, we record these \\nbody measurements at various stages of development to study the growth pattern and check the nutritional status. \\n\\uf0b7 Weight: Weight is a commonly used indicator of body size, as it reflects the level of food intake. \\nThe weight of children is recorded regularly to check if there is a normal gain. The weight can be plotted against age to \\nsee if the pattern of growth is normal, by comparing it with the normal curve. If a  child fails to gain weight, and does'),\n",

We can do the same with \\nadults by comparing their weights with their corresponding heights in order to know their nutritional status. \\nLinear Measurements: Measurements of height, circumferences of head, chest and mid -arm, and skin fold thickness \\nare also known as linear measurements. \\n2. Dietary assessment:  \\nWe have learnt that nutritional status is affected by the amounts and kinds of foods we normally eat . We take physical \\nmeasurements to assess the nutritional status (condition). If the condition is not satisfactory, we will want to modify \\nthe diet. This is done by assessing the present food intake pattern of the individual to be able to modify it suitably. \\nHence, the dietary assessment needs to be carried out. \\n  When and How to Record Food Intake: \\nWe need to know the normal or habitual pattern of food intake. Therefore, we select three normal working days to \\nrecord the food intake, which does not include Sundays, holidays , festivals as generally these days have special \\nmenus, and the schedule of eating is different . We write down the foods they eat each day at each meal. The \\nsnacks, fruits and beverages they take between the meals or with the meals are also recorded. Record the amount \\nof each preparation eaten and  also the time when it was eaten. The amount can be recorded in volume or weight. \\nLater we can convert all the amounts into weights. \\nEvaluation of Food Intake Data \\nWe can evaluate the food intake to check h ow the food selection compares with the daily food guide. This is \\nqualitative check and will help to identify if any of the food groups are missing from the day's intake. Secondly, one \\ncan compare the amounts of foods taken with the suggested minimum number of servings to see if the amounts of \\nfoods included are insufficient. This evaluation will help to decide what changes need to be made in  the diet to \\nimprove the nutritional status. \\n1.6 SUMMARY \\nConsumption of nutritious diet in right (ideal) amount and proportion helps in maintenance of good health. Therefore, a \\ngood knowledge and understanding of the food sources of these various nutritional  components, their metabolism, and \\ntheir requirements for different age and physiological groups is an essential prerequisite for maintaining good health. This \\ncourse is an attempt to provide this knowledge and skills. \\nThe last three decades has seen a tremendous progress in nutrition. Although the  importance of nutrition in growt h, \\ndevelopment and the prevention of nutritional  deficiency diseases was well recognized it is only in the last  three decades \\nthat the frontiers of nutritional science has expanded to include newer  and more dimensions of health such as prevention \\nof chronic degenerative diseases, retardation of ageing and promotion of mental well being. \\nHuman beings require a large number of nutrients, about 40, for many of which the  requirements are well established. In \\naddition, recent advances have shown that the diet components like carotenoid pigments, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, \\nanthocyanins, lignins etc.are bioactive compounds with a potential role in the prevention of  degenerative diseases and in \\ndetoxification. \\nThe earlier dictum that if the diet provided adequa te energy to meet our requirements,  then it is likely to be adequate in \\nother respects, is no longer true. We have to make  conscious efforts to have a healthy diet. If we are a nutrition \\nprofessional or a dietitian, then we also 'have the responsibility of planning diets for others both for health and in diseases \\nand in addition, we will be counseling a large number of people on appropriate diets.\"),\n",

To some extent protein in the body can also be used \\nby the body to generate energy but that happens only in cases where there is shortage of the other t wo nutrients. While \\ncarbohydrates are an instant source of energy, fats are concentrated fo rm of energy and are stored as reserves as body fat \\nand used when required. \\nBody building foods are which help an infant to grow into an adult and an adult to maintain health. Such foods are protein \\nrich foods as they perform the vital function of growth, repair and maintenance of your body. They include dairy products, \\nmeat, fish and poultry and soya bean. \\n2.2  Classification of Carbohydrates \\nEnergy must be supplied regularly to us through the diet for our survival and maintenance of life an d to carry out all \\nactivities jointly termed as work. Our body derives energy from the catabolism of energy -yielding nutrients: carbohydrates, \\nlipids and proteins. Among these, carbohydrates are the single most abundant source of dietary energ y comprising 50-70% \\nof the total energy intake in different populations. We will learn about the different types of carbohydrates, their utilization \\nby the body and how glucose homeostasis is maintained. In addition, the health benefits of dietary fiber and carbohydrates \\nnot absorbed in the small intestines will also be covered in this unit. \\nCarbohydrates are divided into three major groups: \\n\\uf0b7 Sugars,  \\n\\uf0b7 starches,  \\n\\uf0b7 Cellulose and related material.  \\nCarbohydrates are compounds of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen and their chemical structures are  all based on a common \\nunit of glucose. The units are linked together in many ways and in different numbers to form differe nt carbohydrates. The \\nclassification of carbohydrates depends primarily on the number of units, which may vary from one to  many thous ands. \\nWhile sugars and starches are a major source of your food energy, cellulose is one of the main const ituent of dietary fibre \\nfound in food. \\n2.2.1    Sugars \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Monosaccharide or simple sugar: \\no Glucose, also known as dextrose is found naturally in fruits and plants juices and in the blood of living animals. \\nMost carbohydrates in food are ultimately converted to glucose after digestion. Glucose can also be \\nmanufactured from starch by the action of acid or specific enzymes. Artificially manufactured glucos e syrups \\nalso known as liquid glucose are used to manufacture foods like soft drinks, jams and sugar confectionary. \\no Fructose also occurs naturally in some fruits and vegetables and especially in honey. It is the sweetest sugar. It \\nis also a component of sucrose and is also present in commercial ‘high fructose’ syrups. \\no Galactose is a part of lactose and does not occur in free state. \\n\\uf0b7 Disaccharides \\n      Disaccharides consists of two monosaccharides linked together minus              the elements of water. \\no Sucrose occurs naturally is sugar cane and sugar beet and in lesser amounts in fruits and some root v egetables \\nlike carrots. It is chemical combination of glucose and fructose. The ‘sugar’ that we eat, whether w hite or \\nbrown and essentially pure sucrose. \\no Maltose is a combination of 2 glucose units and is formed during the breakdown of starch by digestion.  Malt is \\nalso formed when grain is germinated for production of malt liquor(beer). \\no Lactose is a combination of glucose and galactose and occurs only in milk, including human milk. It is less sweet \\nthan sucrose or glucose. \\n\\uf0b7 Properties of sugars \\n\\uf0b7 All sugars (monosaccharides and disaccharides) dissolve in water and are varying sweet in taste. The y form \\nwhite or colourless crystals and their taste can be modified b y cooking (caramelization). Sugars are a readily \\navailable source of energy and sweetness and also widely used in food industry like jam making, cann ing, \\nfreezing (as preservatives), biscuits, cakes, soft drinks, chocolates (to provide texture and consistency).'),\n",

They exist in granules of a size and shape characteristic for each plant. So the st arch of a potato is \\ndifferent from the starch found in flour 9wheat0. In the raw form they are indigestible but when hea ted or cooked in the \\npresence of water, the starch granules swell and eventually gelatinize. This makes them more easy to digest. \\nGlycogen is similar to starch in composition but is made from glucose only by animals and not by plants. Small amoun ts are \\nstored in the liver and muscles which act as an energy reserve. \\n \\n2.2.3  Cellulose and related materials \\n \\nThese polysaccharides provide structure to vegetables, fruits and grains and make them rigid and fibrous. These structures \\nenclose the starch granules. They are insoluble in water. Together with lignin (which is not a carbo hydrate), they are the \\nmain component of dietary fibre. Cellulose consists of many thousands of glucose units. It cannot be digested by man, but is \\na food of cows and other nutrients. Cellulose and certain other indigestible polysaccharides add bul k to faeces because of \\ntheir water binding capacity and assist in passage of indigestible materials and waste products through the intestines which \\nis very important to human health. \\n2.2.4 Sources and functions of carbohydrates \\nSources: Plants form sugars in their leaves by the action of sunlight and store them in their roots, stems, t ubers, and seeds \\nas starch. This starch is a major energy reserve for most plants and thus in turn provides a major p art of man’s food energy \\nas well. Apart from sugars like lactose and fructose which are available from milk and fruits and ho ney respectively, other \\nsugars would not have been available through diet without the addition of sucrose and glucose syrups  in jams, cakes, \\nbiscuits, ice cream etc.which are a part of our daily diet today.  \\nHence main sources of  \\nSugars in diet are sugar, sweets, chocolates, milk, fruit, fruit products, biscuits, cakes and main sources of  \\nStarches are bread, potatoes, cereal products \\nFibre are vegetables and cereal products. \\n \\nRefer to Table 2.2.4 for different types of carbohydrates and their sources. \\n Functions: Carbohydrates in the body function primarily in the form of glucose, although a few have structural roles. \\nImportant functions of carbohydrates are: \\n\\uf0b7 Source of energy: Glucose is a major source of energy for all the body cells. One gram of carbohydrate provides 4 \\nKcal. RBCs are particularly dependent on glucose. It is also indispensable for the maintenance of func tional \\nintegrity of the nerve tissue and under normal circumstances; it is the sole source of energy for the brain. Similarly, \\nglucose is important for hear t muscles. Although fatty acids are the preferred regular fuel of heart muscle, \\nglycogen in cardiac muscle is an important emergency source of contractile energy. In a damaged hear t, poor \\nglycogen stores or low carbohydrate intake may cause cardiac symptoms of angina. \\n\\uf0b7 Protein sparing effect : Carbohydrates help in regulating the protein metabolism. Presence of sufficient \\ncarbohydrates to meet energy demands prevents the channeling of too much protein for this purpose. This protein \\nsparing action allows the m ajor portions of protein to be used for its basic structural purpose of tissue building. \\nTherefore, patients who are unable to eat are temporarily administered 5% glucose solution intravenously. \\n\\uf0b7 Antiketogenic effect : Presence of carbohydrates is necessary for normal fat metabolism. In the absence of \\nsufficient carbohydrates, larger amounts of fat are used for energy than the body is equipped to han dle. This \\nresults in incomplete oxidation and accumulation of ketone bodies. This may in turn lead to acidosis , sodium \\nimbalance and dehydration. In extreme conditions such as starvation (carbohydrates are inadequate) a nd \\nuncontrolled diabetes (where carbohydrates are unavailable for energy needs), ketoacidosis is a comm on \\ncomplication. \\n\\uf0b7 Excretion of toxins : Glucuronic acid, a metabolite of glucose, combines with chemical and bacterial toxins and \\nsome normal metabolites in the liver and thereby helps in their excretion.'),\n",

However, monosaccha rides are present in very small amounts in \\nour diet. To be absorbed from the gut, carbohydrates must be broken down to their constituent monosa ccharide units.  \\nLet’s see how these carbohydrates are digested in the gut. \\n Refer to Table 2.2.5 for Digestion of carbohydrates. \\nGlucose and galactose are absorbed into the mucosal cells. Glucose and galactose cannot attach to the carrier until it has  \\nbeen preloaded with sodium as illustrated ill Figure 3.2. Hence, you would realize that oral rehydra tion syrup (ORS) always \\ncontains sodium chloride and glucose / sugar. Fructose is absorbed by a facilitated transport, involving a specific \\ntransporter- GLUT-5.GLUTS or human glucose transporters are the integral proteins, which penetrate and span the lipid \\nbilayer of plasma membrane. \\nFollowing absorption, the monosaccharides enter the portal circulation and are carried to the liver.  Both galactose and \\nfructose are converted to glucose in the hepatocytes. A part of glucose is converted into glycogen while some is catabolized \\nfor energy in the liver. The remainder of glucose passes on into the systemic blood supply and is di stributed among other \\ntissues such as skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and kidney. \\nGlycemic Index \\nWe know that some carbohydrates are rapidly digested and  absorbed, some are digested slowly while some are not \\ndigested at all. Thus, it is obvious that different carbohydrates will raise blood glucose levels to  a different extent. The \\nability of carbohydrates to raise blood glucose is, referred to as  \"Glycemic Index\" (GI). GI is a quantitative assessment of \\nfoods based on postprandial blood glucose response (i.e. blood glucose level after a meal) expressed as a \\'percentage of the \\nresponse to an equivalent carbohydrate portion of a reference food\\'. The reference food is white bread with a GI set at 100.  \\nKnowing about GI of foods helps us in prescribing therapeutic diets like diabetic and energy -controlled diets You would \\nrealize that the dietary GI provides an indication of the rate at which, carbohydrate foods are digested. It allows ranking of \\nfoods from those which give rise to the highest blood glucose and insulin responses (high glycernic food) to those \\nassociated with the lowest blood glucose and insulin responses (low GI foods).High GI foods lead to a rapid rise in blood \\nglucose and insulin levels. Hyper - insulinemia in turn may down regulate insulin receptors and therefore reduce insulin \\nefficiency resulting in insulin resistance. On the contrary, low GI foods result in reduced peak ins ulin concentrations and \\nreduced insulin demand thus decreasing the risk of type I1 diabetes. \\nThe health benefits include reduced insulin demand, improved blood glucose control and reduced blood  lipid levels. All \\nthese factors play an important role in the prevention and manag ement of chronic diseases including diabetes, coronary \\nheart disease and certain cancers \\n2.2.6 Nutritional requirement and health aspects \\nIn our daily diet almost 60-70% of energy is contributed by carbohydrates. Majority of them are comprised of starch (f rom \\ncereals, millets, pulses and root vegetables), while a small amount is also contributed by sucrose ( sugar), glucose and \\nfructose (fruits), as well as, lactose (milk and milk products). \\nIn certain disorders changes need to be made. \\n\\uf0b7 Lactose intolerance: In case of lactose intolerance, the ingestion of lactose leads to passage of the sugar to the \\nlarge bowel, where it is fermented to produce SCFA and gases, which causes discomfort. Lactose is present in dairy \\nproducts such as milk, cheese, yoghurt, ice cream etc. Hence, these foods need to be avoided.'),\n",

The most common forms of diabetes are \\ninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM or type I diabetes) and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM \\nor type 2 diabetes).IDDM results from the autoimmune destruction of the a -cells the endocrine pancreas, the \\nconsequence of which is insulin insufficiency. In this, the patient requires exogenous supply of insulin. The amount \\nof carbohydrate and frequency of feeding is modified and depends on the insulin dose, type of insuli n and the \\nweight of the person. \\n \\nHealth aspects: \\nThe main work of all sugar and starches (carbohydrates) are to provide energy to the body but they also have physio logical \\nimpact as well. Excessive consumption of sugars is associated with tooth decay, obesity, heart disea ses and bowel diseases \\nlike appendicitis and bow el cancer. However, when low fat diets are eaten, energy can be supplied by fiber rich starchy \\nfoods rather than sugar diets. For some people especially children, digesting lactose is a problem a nd results in digestive \\ndisturbances. This is also known as lactose intolerance.  \\n \\nBlood glucose regulation: \\nNormally after a meal, when blood glucose levels increase, the peptide hormones (such as cholecystok inin) secreted from \\nenteroendocrine cells within the mucosa of the small bowel amplify the response of the b -cells of pancreas resulting in the \\nsecretion of insulin. Insulin facilitates the transport of glucose by glucose transporter - GLUT 4 into the adipocytes and \\nmuscle cells and stimulates glycogenesis (synthesis of glycogen) and fatty acid biosynthesis, thu s returning the blood \\nglucose to homeostatic level. \\nThis is when the glucose level is high in blood. However, when glucose level falls in case of post a bsorptive state, the fall in \\nblood glucose level signals the reversal of the pancreatic hormonal secreti on i.e. decreased insulin and increased glucagon \\nrelease. Blood glucose levels are maintained by the breakdown of glycogen and in this way, the gluco se demands of brain, \\nRBCs and testis are met. \\nToo much of fluctuation in this process leads to diabetes. \\nDiabetes, which is a metabolic disorder and effects the normal lifestyle of an individual is also rela ted to the amount of \\nglucose in the blood. Diabetics have to monitor and control their total carbohydrate intake in order  to keep diabetes under \\ncheck. \\nRefer to table 2.2.6 for regulation of blood glucose \\nCarbohydrate malabsorption:  Carbohydrates malabsorption is usually caused by an inherited or acquired (intestinal \\ninfection, celiac disease, PEM) defect in the brush border oligosaccharidases, the most common being 'lactose intolerance'. \\nIn such individuals, ingestion of lactose leads to passage of the sugar to the large bowel, where it  is fermented to produce \\nshort chain fatty acids (SCFA) and gases. In humans, lactase activity declines as individuals grow. \\n2.3  Classification of Fats \\nHere we will learn in detail the types and functions of fats and oils, their requirements and significance in our overall health. \\nToday changing dietary patterns and sedentary lifestyles are leading to high risk of some diseases, especially heart diseases. \\nOn the other hand, smart decisions on qualitative and quantitative aspects of fat in diet can in fac t prevent the onset of \\ncertain diseases associated with today’s lifestyles. \\nAt the end of this unit, there are self assess ment exercises to recapitulate various dimensions of knowledge regarding \\ndietary fats and oils. You will acquire adequate skills and confidence to prescribe fats and oils to  any community. Tips are \\ngiven to reduce fat intake in diets which will come handy in counseling patients of obesity, heart diseases, diabetes and \\ncancer. You will be able to modify fat intake of patients with fat malabsorption and liver diseases.  \\nFats and oils, are also chemically known as  lipids.

They \\nare classified as: \\n\\uf0b7 Simple lipids \\n\\uf0b7 Compound lipids and \\n\\uf0b7 Derived lipids \\nLet us get to know each one of these. \\n\\uf0b7 Simple lipids  are fatty acid esters of glycerol, called triacyglycerols or triglycerides (for e.g. fats and oils) or higher \\nalcohols (for e.g. waxes).Triglycerides is the major form of lipids present in human diets. They are  the major sources of \\nfatty acids to the body.  \\n\\uf0b7 Compound lipids  are the simple lipids wh ich combine with proteins (lipoproteins), carbohydrates (glycolipids), \\nphosphates (phospholipids) etc. \\n\\uf0b7 Derived lipids refer to fatty acids, glycerol, cholesterol and other derived compounds including fat -soluble vitamins, \\nhormones and bile. Man can synthesize cholesterol in the body but some amount also comes from the diet. Cholesterol \\nis present only in foods of animal origin. \\nNature of fatty acids present in the triglyceride determines the physio-chemical properties and biological significance of the \\nlipid. Triglycerides made of saturated fatty acids are solids at room temperature and are called fats. If unsaturated fatty \\nacids are present, they are liquid at room temperature and are called oils. What do we mean by saturated and unsaturated \\nfatty acids? Let us understand fatty acids in a little more detail. \\n2.3.1  Fatty acids \\nFatty acids are categorized as: \\n\\uf0b7 Saturated and Unsaturated, - \\n\\uf0b7 Short chain, medium chain and long chain, \\n\\uf0b7 Essential fatty acids, and \\n\\uf0b7 Trans-fatty acids. \\nThese categories are more suitable from the nutritional standpoint of view and are not essentially exclusive as the fatty \\nacids may overlap in these categories but their applications in normal and therapeutic diets warrant s this classification. For \\nexample, a dietitian prescribes medium cha in triglycerides in liver disorders but on the other hand, saturated fatty acid \\nintake should be limited in normal diets for prevention of heart diseases. \\nSo, then, let us now get to know them. \\nSaturated fatty acids (SFA)  are those fatty acids which lack double bond, like palmitic acid (16:0), stearic acid (18:O) etc. \\nAnimal fats, coconut oil, palm oil and vanaspati are good sources of SFA.  \\nMonounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) contain a single double bond. \\nThe examples include palmito oleic acid (16: 1) and oleic acid (18: 1). Its sources are olive oil, canola oil, groundnut oil, rice \\nbran oil, red palm oil and sesame oil. \\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) contain more than one double bond in their structure. These double bo nds can be \\ncounted from -COOH end or -CH3 end. Linoleic \\nacid (C18:2, n-6) and Linolenic acid (18:3, n-3) are essential fatty acids, which are \\nnot synthesized in the body. They are obtained from oils rich in PUFA content. PUFA is present  mostly in vegetable oils \\nbut fish oil is particularly rich. Linoleic acid is also known as as omega 6 fatty acid and linolenic acid as omega 3 fatty acid. \\n.'),\n",

Butter contains small chain \\nfatty acids. They are also obtained during fermentation. \\nMedium chain fatty acids are 6-10 carbon chain length. They are present in butter and coconut oil. They are recommended \\nin liver disorders due to ease in their absorption. \\nLong chain fatty acids contain more than 12 carbon chain. Essential fatty acids are all long chain fatty acids.  \\nWhat are essential fatty acids and their roles in our body? \\nEssential Fatty Acids (EFA) \\nThere are two essential fatty acids - linoleic and linolenic acid as mentioned above. Their structures are depicted in Box 5.2. \\nThey are both 18 carbon compounds with more than one double bond. Omega - 3 (n-3) and omega-6 (n-6) fatty acids need \\nto be derived from the daily diets. These are known to be cardio -protective and are also present in fish oil. Omega 3 and \\nOmega 6 fatty acids are part of vital body structures and have an important  role in immune system, formation of cell \\nmembrane and in  production of  hormone -like compounds called eicosanoids. These hormone -like compounds include \\nprostacyclins, prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes. These compounds are potent regulators of vital body \\nfunctions like blood pressure, child birth, blood clotting, immune response, inflammatory responses and stomach \\nsecretions. \\nWhat do we mean by trans-fatty acids? \\nTrans fatty acids \\nTrans-fatty acids are produced when vegetable oils are hydrogenated to make margarines, partially hydrogen ated \\nvegetable shortening and vanaspati. Hence, major sources of trans -fatty acids to hurnan diets are commercially baked \\nproducts, deep fried snacks in vanaspati and sweets. Small amount of trans -fatty acids are also present in milk fat.  \\nMetabolically, trans-fatty acids and saturated fatty acids raise blood cholesterol levels. \\nRefer to table 2.3.1 for different types of fats and oils & their fatty acids \\n2.3.2  Sources of fats and functions of fats \\nVegetable sources: In plants fats are formed from carbohydrates. When seeds such as sunflower and cottonseed ripen, \\ntheir starch content decreases as their fat content rises. Oilseeds such as these and ground nuts, coconuts, rapeseeds, palm \\nkernels and soya beans contain about 20 to 40 percent of oil and are chiefly used in manufacture of margarine. \\nAnimal sources: Animals including man store excess energ y almost entirely in deposits of fat, the amount of which is \\nvariable. Like in plants this fat can be made from carbohydrates. But animals can also lay down fat from their dietary fat. Fat \\nin diet comes mainly from milk and milk products, fatty fish, meat and poultry which are all animal sources. \\nFunctions of Fats: \\n\\uf0b7 Fats contribute to texture, flavour; taste and increase palatability of the diet. They provide an effective medium of heat \\ntransfer in deep-frying and transfer of flavours from Indian spices. \\n\\uf0b7 Fats have highest heat energy density of 9 Kcal/g. It is the major storage form of energy in body requiring least space \\nand minimum water or hydration as compared to protein in muscle. \\n\\uf0b7 Fats are essential for meeting nutritional needs of essential fatty acids like linoleic acid (n-6) and alpha linolenic acid (n-\\n3). Saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol can be synthesized in the bod y, hence the diet \\nonly adds-on to their total amount available in the body.  \\n\\uf0b7 Fats promote absorption of fat soluble vitamins like vitamin A, D, E and K. \\n\\uf0b7 Fat intake ensures satiety. It imparts feeling of fullness and satisfaction and thus delays onset of hunger.

Some lipids act as electrical insulators \\nallowing rapid propagation of depolarization waves along the myelinated nerves. The fat content of the nervous tissues \\nis particularly high. In anorexia nervosa, the body fat falls dangerously low (< 5%) shows problems i n insulation. Body \\nhair stands erect to trap air and simulate insulation. \\n\\uf0b7 Some dietary fats contain antioxidants. Most of them contain antioxidants which confer stability to the oil and prevent \\nrancidity. For example, OryznnoE (1.2-1.7%) in physically refi ned rice bran oil helps to elevate HDL, decrease plasma \\ncholesterol, treat nerve imbalance, menopause disorders, retard ageing and acts as anti -dandruff and anti -itching \\nagent. Tocotrienols, tocopherols and squalene are antioxidants conferring oxidative stability to the oil. \\n2.3.3  Nutritional requirement of fats and health aspects \\nJust like the other macronutrients, requirements of visible fats for all age groups are computed and guidelines are given for \\nselection of fats. For this, we must consider the to tal fat intake, which includes both visible and invisible fat in food. Let us \\ntake a look at the total fat requirements to meet minimum essential fatty acid requirements in all age groups. We start with \\nadults. \\n\\uf0b7 Adults \\nA desirable amount of a linoleic acid to be consumed by a normal adult is 3en% (ICMR, 1990). The invisible fat present in \\nthe usual Indian foods is high in linoleic acid content (rice, wheat, bengal gram, red gram). Hence an average Indian has \\nsufficient linoleic acid in his diet. 5 en% in a 2400 Kcal diet works out to be 12 g / day. This implies that 3 tsp of cooking oil \\nor table fat a day meets adult requirements. \\n\\uf0b7 Pregnancy and Lactation \\nLinoleic acid requirements should be raised to 4.5 en% during pregnancy This can be met from 30 g/d of oil which has >20% \\nlinoleic acid. Similarly, linoleic acid requirement during lactation rises to 5.7 en% which corresponds to 45 g oil intake which \\nhas > 20% of linoleic acid. \\n\\uf0b7 Infancy \\nAdequate breast-feeding ensures 30 g fat intake by infants, of which 10% is linoleic acid and 1% is linolenic acid, which \\nmeets EFA needs of infants of 6 -enpercentage. Infants who are weaned completely or partially should be given enough \\nvegetable oil with a high linoleic acid content to ensu re 6 en% of linoleic acid. Research indicates that  n -3 fatty acids are \\nhighly essential for infants as they are particularly important for brain development. Hence it is important to include DHA or  \\ndocosa-hexaenoic acid . \\n\\uf0b7 Young and Older Children \\nYoung c hildren need 3 en%, which can be easily met from 8 -10 g of oil in diet. However, more visible oil is needed to \\nimprove energy density of diets otherwise cereal based diets become bulky. ICMR (1990) recommends 20  g/d in children's \\ndiet from oil which has at least 20% linoleic acid. \\nRefer to table 2.3.3 for fat requirements of Indians. \\nChoice of Cooking Medium in Indian Diets \\nICMR (1998) has given dietary guidelines to maintain n -6: n-3 ratio of 5:10, which ensures long term health. For ensuring \\nthe appropriate balance of fatty acids in cereal -based diets and in the diets of those who do not eat fish and are primarily \\nvegetarians like in the case of many Indian diets, we need to depend on plant foods rich in linoleni c acid for ex. wheat, \\nbajra, blackgram, cowpea, rajmah, soybean, green leafy vegetables, fenugreek and mustard seeds .\"),\n",

Now there is a need to decide on the upper limit of fat  c onsumption as well. \\nContemporary society is showing nutritional transition and access to fast foods and fried snacks while eating out is in vogue. \\nThis leads to an increased intake of saturated fatty acid, milk and milk products, flesh foods and s ugar instead of whole \\ncereals, millets and pulses. This is likely to decrease EFA intake from invisible sources and raise SFA. The total calories a re \\nalso high, especially if accompanied by alcohol consumption. \\nWe have already discussed that fried foods and baked p roducts could be a source of trans -fatty acids. Further, the quality \\nand source of frying oil is not known. May be the oil used is highly reused and abused. It is  alway s better to select dishes  \\nprepared by other cooking methods like boiling, steaming, bra ising etc. than frying for lesser oil intake. Dish selection and \\nbehavior modifications are vital to avoid high fat intake. \\nHealth aspects: \\nDiseases due to excessive consumption of fat and their preventive methods: \\nThree diseases have shown close link to excessive dietary fat intake: obesity, heart diseases and cancer. \\n\\uf0b7 Obesity: \\nIn obesity, cutting down total energy intake or increasing output to ensure energy balance is the ba sic principle of \\nprevention. Fat being energy dense is always dangerous in large amounts.Selection of foods and modified cooking methods \\nfurther prevent excessive fat intake. Low fat diets should be given with high fibre and fluid diet t o ensure compliance and \\nsatiety. \\n\\uf0b7 Heart disease: \\nHeart diseases show strong links to fat and cholesterol intake. Foods rich in cholesterol are of ani mal origin .Higher dietary \\ncholesterol increases blood cholesterol but high blood cholesterol with family history does not nece ssarily gain on \\ncholesterol-free diet. Both drug and low cholesterol diet is recommended. Vegetable oils have no cholesterol. \\nThe reference of 'good' and 'bad' cholesterol to dietary fats is in reference to the effect in blood  lipids and HDL/LDL ratio . \\nHigh intakes of n -6 polyunsatura ted fats have been associated with the reduced total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol \\nconcentrations that are associated with low risk of CHD. In general, epidemiological studies have de monstrated an inverse \\nassociation between n -6 polyunsaturated fatty aci d intake and risk of CHD. N -3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (particularly, \\neicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) have been shown to reduce the risk of CH D and stroke by a \\nmultitude of mechanisms:  \\n\\uf0b7 by preventing arrhythmias,  \\n\\uf0b7 reducing atherosclerosis,  \\n\\uf0b7 decreasing platelet aggregation,\"),\n",

Proteins contain carbon, hydrogen, nitro gen, \\nsulphur and some also contain phosphorus. Proteins are chains of amino acids held together by peptid e bonds, only about \\n20 different amino acids are used but the number of ways in which they can be arranged is almost infinite. It is the specific \\nand unique sequence of these units which gives each protein its characteristic structural and enzyma tic properties. Let us \\nconsider the two very familiar protein s. One of them is the egg white protein, which is very sensitive. It denatures on \\nheating, dissolves easily in water and is quite reactive, while the other one is keratin of nails an d hoofs, is wholly insoluble, \\ntough and chemically inert and resistant. He nce, it is not easy to classify proteins. Besides classifying proteins on the basis \\nof soluble and insoluble, proteins have been further classified based on the following attributes:'),\n",

These amino acids can be broadly divi ded into two types: \\nessential and non essential. Essential amino acids cannot be made in the body at least in amounts sufficient for health and \\nmust therefore be present in the food. Non essential amino acids are equally necessary but they diff er in that it is possible  \\nfor them to be made from any excess of certain amino acids in the diet.  \\nThe 8 amino acids essential for adults are: \\nIsoleucine phenylalanine leucine methionine \\nThreonine tryptophan  valine  lysine \\nAnd another amino acid histidine is also essential for infants. \\nThe remaining amino acids which are widespread in proteins are: \\n  Alanine arginine aspartic acid cysteine glutamic acid \\n  Glycine proline serine  tyrosine \\n Refer to table no.2.4.1 for classification of amino acids. \\n2.4.2  Sources and function of proteins  \\nThe important sources of proteins in the diets of low -income groups are cereals and legumes but t he overall proportion of \\namino acids in any single vegetable food differ from those needed by man. These proteins are therefore known to have low \\nbiological value.Most animal proteins like meat, fish, eggs and milk are important sources of proteins and have high \\nbiological value. Oilseeds, oilseed meals and soy are also rich sources of proteins. Because there isno way in which excesses \\nof amino acids can be stored in the body, they can be most efficiently used if a complete assortment  is supplied to the \\nbody.this can be achieved by eating a mixed diet. Mixture of animal and vegetable protein like cerea ls with milk, bread and \\ncheese, fish and chips etc provide a sound physiological basis. \\nRefer to table no.2.4.2 for protein content of some important foods. \\nEach of the various proteins in the body serves a specific function in the maintenance of life. Any loss in body protein, in \\nreality, means a loss in cellular function. In contrast to lipids and carbohydrates, proteins have n o true body reserve. \\nHumans when deprived of or insufficiently supplied with protein, compensate for this dietary deficiency by ca tabolizing'),\n",

Cells, tissues, organs and whole systems cannot exist without proteins serving \\ntheir various functions. \\nSo let us get to know the varied functions of proteins in our body. \\no Bodybuilding functions of proteins : The primary functions of proteins are tissue growth and maintenance. \\nProtein contains amino acids - the building blocks -t hat our bodies use to  build and maintain muscles, bone, \\nskin, blood and other organs. Thus, proteins play an important role in growth and body-building. \\no Protein as an energy source : If diet does not furnish enough calories from carbohydrates and fats, proteins \\ncontribute to th e body's energy need by catabolizing. One gram protein yields 4 Kcal. But it is important to \\nunderstand that this is not the major function of proteins. This only happens when the diet does not supply \\nenough energy-giving nutrients. \\no Proteins as enzymes:  From conception to death, living cells use oxygen and metabolize fuel. Cells synthesize \\nnew products, degrade others, and generally are in a state of metabolic flux. For these processes to  occur, \\ncatalysts are needed .These catalysts called 'enzymes' are p roteins. Enzymes are the largest and the most \\nspecialized class of proteins. Each enzyme is unique and catalyzes a specific kind of reaction. In t he cell, \\nenzymes are found in cellular compartments (cytoplasm, nucleus, mitochondria, etc.), as well as, the  \\nmembranes within and around the cell wall. The location of an enzyme is one of its characteristics a nd \\ndictates, in part, its role in metabolism. \\no Proteins as carriers: A large variety of compounds are carried in the blood between tissues and organs of the \\nbody. Some of the compounds require specific protein for their transport. Not only is this specific protein \\nnecessary for the transport of compounds insoluble in blood, but it is also necessary to protect the se \\ncompounds from further reactions that take place during the transport process. \\no Proteins as regulators of water balance : As substrates and solutes are transferred or exchanged across \\nmembranes, water has a tendency to flow to maintain equal osmotic pressure on each side of the membr ane. \\nIf osmotic pre ssure is not maintained, the individual cells either shrink from lack of internal water or burst \\nfrom too much.  Albumin plays a significant role in maintaining the osmotic pressure because of its size and \\nabundance.The protein hormone particularly the Anti -Diuretic Hormone (ADH) plays a role in controlling \\nwater balance. The effect of protein is on the distribution of water amongst the various body compar tments \\nthan on the total body water. \\no Proteins as biological buffers:  Proteins have the ability to accept  or donate hydrogen ions and by doing so \\nthey serve as biological buffers. In blood, there are three important buffering systems - plasma proteins, \\nhemoglobin and carbonic acid bicarbonate. \\no Proteins as structural elements and structural units: Proteins function as enzymes, carriers, binding or \\nreceptor sites or entry ports for a large variety of materials binding, entering or leaving the cell . Thus proteins \\nserve as the structural and functional units of the cell membrane. Proteins are also important int racellular \\nstnictural units. The most important structural function of protein is related Lo skin and connective tissue. The \\nskin is composed of epithelial tissue which covers not only the exterior of the body but also lines the \\ngastrointestinal tract, res piratory tract and the urinary tract. One of the major protein found in the skin is \\n'melanin'. Collagen and elastin are the two distinct types of proteins in the connective tissue. Muscle is \\ncomposed of 20% protein, 75% water and 5% inorganic material, glycogen and other organic compounds. The \\nmajor proteins in muscle are myosin - a large globular protein, and actin – a smaller globular protein. \\no Proteins as lubricants : Tbe mucous of the respiratory tract, oral cavity, vaginal tract and the rectal cavity \\nreduces the irritation which might be caused by materials moving through these passages. This mucous is  a \\nmucoprotein, a conjugated protein which contains hexosamine.. Proteins as lubricants also surround the joints \\nand facilitate their movement. \\no Proteins in the immune system :: Proteins such as y -globulin serve to protect the body against foreign cells. \\nThe immunoglobulins produced by lymphocytes are large polypeptides having more than one basic \\nmonomeric unit. \\n \\n2.4.3  Nutritional requirement of proteins and health aspects \\nThe FAO/WHO Committee (1973) expressed the protein requirements in terms of egg or milk proteins. Th e committee \\ndefined safe level of protein intake as 'the amount necessary to meet the physiological needs and maintain the health of  \\nnearly all the individuals in a specified age/sex group. The term protein requirement means that amount of protein which \\nmust be consumed to provide the amino acids for the synthesis of those body proteins irreversibly\"),\n",

The intake of nitrogen from protein must be sufficient to balance that \\nexcreted; this basic concept is called nitrogen balance. This concept is useful in understanding the minimal need for protein \\nin the diet. \\nProtein requirement is greatly influenced by many factors such as age, environmental temperature, energy intake, gender, \\nmicronutrient intake, infection, activity, previous diet, trauma, pregnancy and lactation. Let us take up each of these factors \\nin detail. \\n\\uf0b7 Age: Protein in excess of maintenance needs is required, when a new tissue is being formed. Certain age periods, when \\ngrowth is rapid, require more dietary protein than other periods.Full term infants have indicated th at a protein intake \\nof 2.0 to 2.5g/ kg/day is needed for satisfacto ry weight gain whereas older infants and children, whose growth rate is \\nnot as rapid as the premature or new born infant, require considerably less protein (1.25g/kg/day). As growth rate \\nincreases during adolescence, the protein needs increase. As the huma n completes his growth, the need for protein \\ndecreases until it arrives at a level which is called the 'maintenance level'. It is at this level that the concept of body \\nprotein replacement by dietary protein applies. \\n\\uf0b7 Environmental temperature : As environmental temperatures rise or fall above or below the range of thermic \\nneutrality; animals begin to increase their caloric expenditure to maintain their body temperature. An increase in \\nenergy needs is accompanied by an increase in the protein requirement for maintenance. In addition, nitrogen is lost \\nduring profuse sweating that occurs in very warm environments which accounts for more protein intake in diet. \\n\\uf0b7 Previous diet:  The effects of previous diet in the determination of protein requirements is quite profo und. \\nMalnourished people have a higher protein requirement than well -nourished people. Every protein in the body has a \\nfunction and if some of these proteins are lost, there is a loss in body function. Support for this concept is seen in the \\nreduced ability of protein depleted animals to fight infection or respond to the metabolic effects of trauma. \\n\\uf0b7 Physical activity:  In a number of studies, the athletic performance of subjects could not be directly related to the \\nquantity of protein consumed above the mini mum requirement unlike a popular fad that that heavy muscular work \\nrequired a heavy protein diet.  Generally as the energy requirement is increased to support the increase in muscular \\nactivity, so too is the protein requirement in much the same manner as de scribed above for the effects of rise in body \\ntemperature. \\nAs can be anticipated, males due to their greater physical activity and larger body size have a larg er protein requirement \\nthan females. Pregnancy, lactation and trauma increase the protein require ments. So, now you realize that a large number \\nof factors play a role in determination of protein requirement. \\nRefer to table no. 2.4.3 for nutritional requirements of protein for Indians in different age groups and physiological stages \\nas suggested by the ICMR.  \\nProteins apart from growth, repair and maintenance also lend a hand in providing energy, if such a situation arises. Excesses \\nof amino acids are converted into glucose in the liver or directly oxidized to provide heat and ener gy. So proteins can be a \\nsource of energy, if required.  \\n \\nNewborn infants can absorb proteins intact from their mother’s milk, including antibodies that provi de protection from \\ninfection. On the other hand, there are individuals who are susceptible to reaction with certain other proteins for ex. Those \\nwith celiac disease react to gluten and some to cow’s milk protein. In addition, some beans like raj mah and soya beans \\ncontain proteins, which are harmful unless well cooked.  \\n \\nDeficiency of protein is one of the most common nutritional di sorders in the world today and affects both adults and \\nchildren especially in less developed nations.The symptoms vary and in many situations, it is diffic ult to separate protein \\ndeficiency from energy deficit. In children, one may observe the different sy mptoms and visualize them all as parts of a \\ncontinuum called protein -energy or protein calorie malnutrition (PEM or PCM) rather than distinctly different nutritional \\ndisorders. \\n2.5  Let us sum up \\nWe studied about carbohydrates, its functions and types. We learnt that carbohydrates provide energy  (4 cal/g). They are \\nformed plants in bewildering array of possible single unit and polymer structures. Humans have the a bility to digest only a \\nfew of the many possible bonds linking carbohydrate units with each other and with other types of organic molec ules. \\nAbout 80% of edible carbohydrates are absorbed as single glucose unit and metabolized.\"),\n",

They are fermented in varying degrees to \\nshort-chain fatty acids, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane in the large bowel. Absorbed short chain fat ty acids are \\nmetabolized in colonic epithelial, hepatic and muscle cells. Thus, these perform a number of beneficial functions. \\nIntakes of optimum amounts of different types of carbohydrates are associated with good health through effects on energy \\nbalance, digestive function, blood glucose control and other risk factors for several chronic diseases. \\n We learnt about the classification of fats, the major difference between fats and oils and the concept of visible and invisible \\nfats. We generally consume fats in the form of triglycerides. Our diets also provid e cholesterol, which is present only in \\nfoods of animal origin. \\nWe then learnt about lipid digestion and absorption, where we discussed that long  chain fatty acids, cholesterol and \\nphospholipids are absorbed through the lymphatic vessels after emulsificati on by bile. Short and medium chain fatty acids \\nare absorbed directly into blood. We also got to know about '.good' and 'bad' cholesterol. \\nThe good cholesterol or HDL is cardio -protective and can be raised by exercise, avoidance of smoking, maintaining norm al \\nweight and eating pattern, Fats have an important role in human nutrition and some amount of it should be present in daily \\ndiet. Use of 2-3 different oils while cooking is good for health. Eating out or eating prepackaged or fast foods  o ften should \\nbe avoided as it leads to an increase in consumption of fats especially trans-fatty acids. \\nWe also learnt that excessive fat intake could lead to major health diseases such as obesity, heart diseases and cancer. \\nHence, a judicious fat intake with a healthy lifestyle and correct eating habits like consumption of fruits and vegetables that \\ninhibit LDL oxidation must be chosen to prevent the risk of these diseases.  \\nWe learnt that proteins are vital to all body cells, tissues, organs and functions of organ system s. The process of digestion, \\nabsorption and metabolism of protein are complex and involve several nutritional and non -nutritional factors. Proteins are \\nwidely distributed in nature, the richest vegetarian source being soybeans. Egg protein has the highest biologic value.  \\nSeveral methods can be employed to determine the protein content of foods, the most popular being th ose based on \\ngrowth and body weight changes. Protein quality in the diet can be improved by mutual supplementatio n of protein rich \\nfoods and cereals. Nutritional requirements of proteins vary with age and physiological activity. Deficiency of proteins leads \\nto the twin disorders of marasmus and kwashiorkor and can be cured by dietary intervention. \\n2.6  Glossary \\n \\nWORDS MEANINGS \\nCARBOHYDRATES \\nDiverticular disease \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\na condition in which small pouches called diverticulae, \\ndevelop at the weak spots in the wall of the colon, that \\neventually bulge out to form pouches  the integral proteins \\nwhich penetrate and span the lipid bilayer of plasma \\nmembrane. \\na product of average glycemic index total  carbohydrate \\nintake. \\nalso called as piles; these are th e small troublesome \\ntumors or swellings with a painful mass of dilate veins in\"),\n",

There are 13 known \\nvitamins, most of which are present in foods while some are produced within the body. Depending on t he property of \\nsolubility, vitamins are divided into two groups, namely, water-soluble and fat-soluble.'),\n",

Fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K, are termed so because they \\nare found in nature in close association with fatty foods such as butter, cream, vegetable oils, mea t, poultry and fish and \\ntheir products. While fat-soluble vitamins -Vitamin A, D, E and K - dissolve in fat before they are absorbed in the blood \\nstream to carry out their functions, water-soluble vitamins i.e. B-complex group and vitamin C dissolve in water.  \\nExcesses of fat soluble vitamins are stored in the liver whereas water soluble vitamins are not stor ed; hence a continuous \\nsupply of them is required in our diets.  \\nMinerals are required by humans for optimal functioning. Most minerals can be detected in the body and only 1 5 of them \\nare known to be essential and must be derived from food. These mineral elem ents are broadly divided into two classes i.e. \\nmacro and micro minerals.  \\nMacro minerals, also referred to as major minerals are distinguished from micro minerals by their occurrence in the body. \\nWhile macro minerals constitute at least 0.01% of the total body weight or at least  5 g in a 60 kg body i.e. they are required \\nin amounts greater than 100 mg per day whereas on the other hand, requirement of micro minerals vari es from a only few \\nmilligrams to micrograms per day. \\nMacro minerals are Calcium, phospho rus, magnesium, sodium, potassium and chloride and micro minerals are iron, zinc, \\ncopper, selenium, chromium, manganese, iodine and fluorine. \\n3.2      Classification of Vitamins, their sources, digestion, absorption, functions and nutritional requirements \\nWe shall discuss about vitamins first and then move onto minerals. Vitamins are classified as water-soluble and fat-soluble \\nvitamins depending on their solubility. Fat-soluble vitamins -vitamin A, D, E and K dissolve in fat before they are absorbed in \\nthe blood stream to carry out their functions. Excesses of these vitamins are stored in the liver. Becau se they are stored, \\nthey are not needed every day in the diet. By contrast, water -soluble vitamins dissolve in water and are not stored. They \\nare eliminated in urine. We need a continuous supply of them in our diets. The water -soluble vitamins are the B -complex \\ngroup and vitamin C. \\n3.2.1  Vitamin A \\nThe chemical name of vitamin A is retinol. Retinol is referred to as pre-formed vitamin A, as it is present in f oods already in \\nthe active form and does not require any conversion. Retinol itself is found only in animal foods but milk and some \\nvegetable foods also contain the deep yellow or orange carotenes which can be converted in the body to retinol and are \\ntherefore sources of vitamin A activity. The most important of these is beta carotene which is the  primary and most \\nefficient pro vitamin A or carotenoid. \\n\\uf0b7 Sources:  Vitamin A or retinol is  found only in foods of animal origin, such as milk, cheese, cream, butter, ghee, egg, fish, \\nkidney and liver, liver oils of fish such as halibut, cod and shark. Provitamin A (so called because it is a precursor and has to \\nbe chemically transformed into re tinal) or B -carotene is found primarily in plant foods, which contain orange or yellow -\\ncolored pigments called carotenoids. B-carotene is the most widely distributed carotenoid in plant foods. Palm fruit and red \\npalm oil are the richest source of beta-carotene and dark green leafy vegetables, ripe fruits such as mango, papaya, apricots \\nand yellow orange vegetables like carrot, pumpkin and sweet potato are rich in B carotene. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Functions: Vitamin A (retinol) is an essential nutrient needed in small amounts by humans for the normal functioning of the \\nvisual system, growth and development, and maintenance of epithelial cellular integrity, immune func tion, and \\nreproduction. \\n1. Vitamin A deficiency is the leading cause of preventable severe visual impairment and blindness, and the most \\nvulnerable are preschool children and pregnant women, particularly in our country. It is ironical th at a small \\namount of less than 10 gm of green leaves can meet the day’s requirement of vitamin A of preschool children. \\nYet an estimated  250,000 to 500,000 VAD children world over become blind every year, and about half of \\nthem die within a year. Administration of large doses of vitamin A to children at -risk has been the most \\npopular approach to control nutritional blindness. \\nThe next function of great significance is the role of vitamin A in differentiation of cells.'),\n",

Role in growth and cellular differentiation : The growth and differentiation of epithelial cells throughout the \\nbody are especially affected by vitamin A deficiency. In additio n, goblet cell numbers are reduced in epithelial \\ntissues and as a consequence, mucous secretions diminish. Cells lining protective tissue surfaces fail to \\nregenerate and differentiate; hence they flatten and accumulate keratin. Xerosis and xerophthalmia a re such \\ndiseases due to deficiency of vitamin A. \\n3. Role in immune response:  Cells lining protective tissue surfaces fail to regenerate and differentiate; hence \\nthey flatten and accumulate keratin.Both factors - the decline in mucous secretions and loss of cel lular \\nintegrity reduce the body's ability to resist invasion from potentially pathogenic organisms. Pathogens can also \\ncompromise the immune system by directly interfering with the production  of some types of protective \\nsecretions and cells. \\n4. Integrity of e pithelial tissues: Vitamin A is essential for the integrity of the mucous -secreting cells. In fact, \\nvitamin A maintains the health of epithelial cells that line internal and external surfaces of the l ungs, \\nintestines, stomach, vagina, urinary tract and bla dder, eyes and skin. These cells act as important barriers to \\nbacteria. Certain epithelial cells secrete mucous to keep the skin, eyes and other mucous membranes moist. In \\ndeficiency, the epithelial tissues are keratinized. The tissues affected are salivar y glands, respiratory tract, \\neyes, skin and sex organs. \\n5. Role as antioxidant:  vitamin A and related nutrients may collectively be important in protecting against \\nconditions related to oxidative stress, such as aging, air pollution, arthritis, cancer, cardio vascular disease, \\ncataracts, diabetes mellitus and infection. Antioxidants protect our cells against the effects of free radicals, are \\npotentially damaging compounds produced as by -products of metabolism, as well as, through exposure to \\ntoxins and pollutants (e.g. smoking). \\n6. Bones and nerves ::T he role of vitamin A in bone formation and the association of its deficiency with the \\ndegeneration of myelin sheath is currently being explored. \\n7. Role in protein metabolism and growth: Severe vitamin A deficiency results in abnormal RNA metabolism and \\nprotein synthesis and hence interferes with growth. Hence vitamin A is also called growth vitamin. \\n8. Role in the synthesis of mucoproteins and macro polysaccharides:  Vitamin A  is vital for the synthesis of \\nmucoproteins  and glycoproteins and incorporation of inorganic sulphate in mucopolysachharides and their \\nsynthesis. \\n9. Role in reproduction : Deficiency of Vitamin A  leads to infertility in the male and failure of' thc female to \\nconceive or resorption or abortion of the fetus, chiefly in animals. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Nutritional requirement and RDA for Vitamin A \\nThe RDA suggested for vitamin A is given in Table 7.l (a). You can observe from the values given in the table that the \\nrequirements are highest during lactation. This is due to the fact that human milk, particularly colostrum is a rich source of \\nvitamin A. It is also evident that the intake recommended for pre -schoolers and older children are equal to that \\nrecommended for adult man and woman. This high level has been suggested keeping in mind the high prevalence rate of \\nclinical vitamin A deficiency in this segment of the population. The recommendations have been based  on the fact that \\nwhat level of vitamin A is required to prevent deficiency and also maintain health. In calculating t he sa fe intake, a \\nnormative storage requirement equivalent to 434 mg RE/day was taken into consideration as anything m ore than that \\ncould also lead to toxicity. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects \\n \\nDeficiency:  \\nVitamin A deficiency (VAD), as you already know, leads to impairment in  the vision, severe infections and even death. It \\nencompasses the full spectrum of clinical consequences associated with sub optimal vitamin A status.  These disorders are \\nknown to include reduced immune competence resulting in increased morbidity and morta lity (largely from increased \\nseverity of infectious diseases), night blindness, corneal ulcers, keratomalacia and related ocular signs and symptoms of \\nxerophthalmia; exacerbation of anemia through sub optimal absorption and utilization of iron and oth er conditions not yet \\nfully identified or clarified (e.g. retardation of growth and development).  \\nToxicity \\nBecause vitamin A is fat-soluble and can be stored, primarily in the liver, routine consumption of large amounts of vitamin A \\nover a period of time can r esult in toxic symptoms, including liver damage, bone abnormalities and joint pain, alopecia, \\nheadaches, vomiting and skin desquamation. In fact, symptoms that occur due to intakes in excess of those recommended \\nover a prolonged period are referred to as symptoms of hypervitaminosis.\"),\n",

Examples include thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, \\npyridoxin, folic acid, cyanocobalamin etc. Although the chemical structure of  each is quite different, and they have several \\nfeatures in common. They act as “co -factors” in different enzyme systems in the body; they tend to occur in the same \\nfoods; and being water soluble, they are not stored for long in the body. These characteris tics mean that diets containing \\ntoo little B-vitamins can lead to multiple deficiency diseases within a few months. \\n3.2.3  Thiamin (vitamin B1 or Aneurin) \\nThiamin is one of the earliest recognized vitamins. It is necessary for the steady and continuous release of energy from \\ncarbohydrate. Thiamin requirements are thus related to the amount of carbohydrate and more or less t o the amount of \\nenergy in the diet. \\n\\uf0b7 Sources: It is widely distributed in both animal and vegetable foods. \\nRich sources :  Rice polishings, wheat germ, dried yeast, yeast extract. \\nGood sources:  Whole cereals, whole wheat, millets, raw and hand -pounded or parboiled rice, pulses, soya \\nbean, dried beans, oilseeds and nuts. \\nFair sources:  Meat, fish, eggs, milk, vegetables and fruits. \\nIt is to be noted that cooking may result in considerable losses from these foods. Fats, sugars and alcoho lic drinks contain \\nno thiamin at all. It is depleted by use of coffee, tannin from black teas, nicotine and alcohol. \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and elimination: After a meal, thiamin is found in the intestine in the free form. Its absorption involves \\ntwo mechanisms- both active and passive. It is absorbed primarily from the upper jejunum by diffusion and by an acti ve \\ntransport mechanism but can also occur in the du odenum and ileum. After absorption, only a small part passes into \\ncirculation as free thiamin while a greater part is converted into thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) in the liver and intestinal \\nmucosa. A small quantity of thiamin is also converted into thiamin triphosphate (TTP).It is then excreted in urine. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Functions of Thiamine:  \\nThiamin has a key metabolic role in the cellular production of energy; mainly in glucose metabolism i.e. it helps the body \\ncells convert carbohydrates into energy. Thiamin is also es sential for the functioning of the heart, muscles, and nervous \\nsystem. Other functions are:  \\n1. Regulator of enzyme activity: Thiamin regulates the enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. \\n2. Coenzyme in enzyme catalyzed reactions: Thiamin functions as the coenzyme thiamin pyrophosphate (TP?) in the \\nmetabolism of carbohydrates and branched chain amino acids. \\n3. TPP and TTP are vital for the nerves and cardiac tissues: TPP and TTP are inter convertible and are involved in \\ncarbohydrate metabolism. When there is insufficient thiamin, the overall decrease in carbohydrate metabolism \\nand its interconnection with amino acid metabolism has severe consequences, such as a decrease in the formation \\nof acetylcholine for neural function. Thus, deficiency in the tissues affects energy metabolism in nervous tissue and \\ncardiac muscle. \\n4. Role in the conversion carbohydrates to fats: Thiamin helps in the initial steps of fatty acid and sterol production. \\nIn this way, thiamin also helps convert carbohydrate to fat for storage of potential energy. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Recommended Dietary Allowance: As thiamin facilitates energy utilization, its requirements have been expressed on the \\nbasis of energy intake, which can vary depending on activity levels.

The early clinical features are anorexia and dyspepsia, associated with heaviness  and weakness of the \\nlegs. There is tenderness of the calf muscles on pressure with complaints of \\'pins and needles\\' pain  and numbness in the \\nlegs. The pers on feels weak and get easily exhausted while working. If not treated, he or she may develop polyneuritic \\nberiberi, that is, inflammation of many or all of the peripheral nerves. A detail discussion on the different forms of beriberi \\nfollows: \\nWet beriberi: Edema is the important feature of wet beriberi. It may develop rapidly and involve not only the legs  but also \\nthe face, trunk and serous cavities. Palpitation and breathlessness are present. The calf muscles ar e frequently tense, \\nslightly swollen and tender on pressure. \\nDry beriberi: Early symptoms are similar to those found in wet beriberi. The muscles become progressively wasted a nd \\nweak and walking becomes difficult. \\nInfantile beriberi: Infantile beriberi is commonly seen in many South-East Asian countries where the diets consist mostly of \\n\"polished rice\" and are deficient in thiamin. \\nToxicity: \\nThiamin toxicity is not a problem because renal clearance of the vitamin is rapid. Since the body st ores of thiamin are very \\nlow, we must ensure adequate daily intake. \\n3.2.4 Riboflavin (vitamin B2) \\nRiboflavin was discovered in milk  as a pigment possessing a bright yellow green color and is essential for the utilization of \\nenergy from food. Although it is widely distributed in foods, especially animal foods, about one third of intake comes from \\none source i.e. milk. Riboflavin is destroyed by ultraviolet rays hence exposure of milk to sunlight is not advised. \\n\\uf0b7 Sources:  The food sources of riboflavin include: \\n Rich sources: Liver, dried yeast, egg powder, milk powder. \\nGood sources: Whole cereals, millets, pulses, green leafy vegetables, oilseeds and nuts, meat, fish, eggs and milk. \\nFair sources:  Milled cereals and cereal products, roots and tubers, other vegetables and fruits. \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and elimination: Riboflavin is absorbed from the small intestine through the portal vein and is passed \\nto all tissues via general circulation. Absorption occurs in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract by specialized \\ntransport. Riboflavin is also synthesized by intestinal bacteria and then absorbed by the colon. Riboflavin is not stored in the \\nbody. A major part is excreted in urine and the rest is broken down in the tissues. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Functions of Riboflavin:  Riboflavin plays an important role in human metabolic processes and in maintaining good health. \\n1. Precursor of co-enzymes: The major function of\\' riboflavin is to serve as the precursor of the coenzymes FMN \\n(flavin mononzicleotide ) and FAD ( flavinadenine dinucleotide and of\\' the covalently bound flavins. \\n2. Role in respiratory clzailz : The flavocoenzymes (FMN aud FAD) participate in oxidation -reduction reactions in \\nmetabolic pathways and in energy production via the respiratory chain. \\n3. Drug and lipid metabolism: Flavoproteins catalyze dehydrogenation reactions,as well as, hydroxylations, oxidative \\ndecarobxylations, deoxygenatio~ls and reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. \\n4. Antioxidant activity: Flavoproteins also have powerful antioxidant activity from their role as precursors to FMN \\nand FAD. \\n5. Protective role:  Riboflavin protects the octodei~nalt issues and prevents lesioils of the skin, eye and nervous \\nsystem. Riboflavin ameliorates cardiac damage and also has anti malarial effects. \\n6. Regulatory functions: Riboflavin helps with the regulatory functions of some hormones  involved in carbohydrate \\nmetabolism. \\n7. Other functions: Riboflavin interrelates with ocher B vitamins, notably niacin, which requires FAD for its formation \\nfrom tryptophan, and vitamin B6 which requires FMN for conversion.'),\n",

Negative \\nnitrogen balance reduces riboflavin requirements and excretion. Physical activity reduces urinary ri boflavin excretion. \\nHence, the dietary requirement is increased by ex ercise and increased physical activity. Therefore, the RDA for individual \\nintake follows the similar pattern as for thiamin. RDI for riboflavin for adults are 0.6 mg/ 1000 Kc al, i.e. for adult males, the \\nrequirements are 1.4 mg/day while for adult females,  it is 1.1 mg per day and increase up to 1.3 - 1.4 mg per day during \\npregnancy and lactation. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects:  \\nDeficiency: \\nDeficiency of Riboflavin results in the condition of hypo- or aribc?flavi~iosisw, ith sore throat, hyperaemia (condition in \\nwhich the blood collects in a part of the body), oederna of the pharyngeal and oral mucous membranes, cheilosi s (cracking \\nof the corner of the mouth), angular stomatitis (inflammation at the corner of the mouth), glossitis  (inflammation or the \\ninfection of the tongu e), seborrheic dermatitis and normochromic, normocytic anaemia associated with pure red cell \\ncytoplasia of the bone marrow. As riboflavin deficiency almost invariably occurs in combination with a deficiency of other B-\\ncomplex vitamins, some of the symptoms (e.g. glossitis and dermatitis) may result from other complicating deficiencies. The \\nmajor cause of hyporiboflavinosis is inadequate dietary intake as a result of limited food supply, which is sometiines \\nexacerbated by poor food storage or processing. Children in developing countries demonstrate clinical signs of riboflavin \\ndeficiency during periods when gastrointestinal infections are prevalent.  Soine cases of riboflavin deficiency have been \\nobserved in south-east Asian school children infected with hookworm. \\nToxicity \\nRiboflavin toxicity is not a problem because of the limited intestinal absorption of this vitamin. \\n3.2.5 Niacin \\nNicotinic acid and nicotinamide are two forms of another B -vitamin (known collectively as niacin) which is involved in the \\nutilization of food energy. Nicotinaimide is required for the synthesis of the active forms of niacin i.e NAD and its phosphate \\nwhich functions as a cofactor for various coenzymes in our body. Nicotinic acid was first isolated f rom rice polishing and \\nshown to be a component of coenzyme I and II and several transporting enzymes in the tissues. \\n\\uf0b7 Food sources of Niacin \\nNiacin is widely distributed in plant and animal foods mainly as the pyridine nucleotides NAD and NA DP. The food sources \\nof niacin are highlighted herewith: \\nRich sources: Dried yeast, rice polishings, peanuts, liver. \\nGood sources: Whole cereals legumes, meat and fish. \\nFair sources: Milled cereals, maize, roots and tubers, vegetables, milk, eggs. \\nWhole cereals are good sources of niacin, but the removal of the bran in the milling of wheat reduces the niacin content of \\nwhite wheat flour to a low level. Niacin is readily soluble in water, but is resistant to heat, oxidation and alkalis. It is, in fact, \\none of the most stable vitamins. \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and elimination : \\nNicotinic acid and nicotinamide are rapidly absorbed from the intestine rather than the stomach. NAD  and NADP, the main \\ndietary forms of niacin are hydrolyzed by enzymes in the intestinal mucosa to release nicotinamide. The intestinal mucosa is \\nrich in niacin conversion enzymes such as glycohydrolase. Niacin is methylated in the liver and excr eted in the urine along \\nwith oxidation products. The pattern of niacin products excreted depends on the amount and the form of niacin ingested \\nand the niacin status of the individual. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions of  Niacin :   \\n1) Protective role: Nicotinic acid is vital to the normal functioning of the skin, intestinal tract and nervous system. \\nIt protects the tissues from pellagraic lesions. \\n2) Coenzyme activity: NAD is required for transfer reactions involved in DNA repair and calcium mobilization. \\nNAD functions in intracellular respiration and with enzymes involved in the oxidation of fuel substrate. \\n3) Metal chelating ability : This explains its biological interactions  with essential trace metals. It is a part of the \\nproposed glucose tolerance factor, an organo chromium complex that may potentiate insulin response in man.'),\n",

Thes e are energy utilization, body size and dietary \\ntryptophan. The efficiency of conversion of tryptophan to niacin is affected by various factors incl uding the amount of \\ntryptophan and niacin ingested protein and energy intake, as well as, vitamin B6 and B2 status. ICMR recommended RDI for \\nindividual intake of niacin as niacin equivalents (NE) for adult is 6.6 mg per 1000 Kcal. For a sede ntary male and sedentary \\nfemale it is 16 and 12 mg per day, respectively. With pregnancy and lactation, the RDA increases t o about 14 - 16 mg per \\nday. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects: \\nDeficiency: \\nThe disease is characterized by 3 D's- dermatitis, diarrhoea and dementia. Niacin (nicotinic acid) deficiency classically results \\nin pellagra which is a chronic wasting disease associated with a characteristic erythematous dermatitis,a dementia after \\nmental changes including insomnia and apathy preceding an overt encephalopathy, and diarrhea resulti ng from \\ninflammation of the intestinal mucous surfaces. \\nToxicity \\nAlthough therapeutically useful in lowering serum cholesterol, administration of chronic high oral doses of nicotinic acid can \\nlead to hepatotoxicity, as well as, dermatologic manifestations. \\n3.2.6 B6 (pyridoxine) \\nVitamin B6 or pyridoxine is involved in the metabolism of amino acids includi ng the conversion of tryptophan to nicotinic \\nacid; the requirements are thus related to the protein content of the diet. Pyridoxine or vitamin B6 is one of the B complex \\nvitamins which prevents and cures dermatitis in rats fed on vitamin B6 deficient diets. \\n\\uf0b7 Food sources of pyridoxine: \\nVitamin B6 occurs widely in food, especially in meats and fish, eggs, whole cereals and some vegetab les. The main sources \\nin the diet are potatoes and other vegetables, milk and meat. \\nRaw foods contain more of this vitamin than cooked foods. The food sources include: \\nRich sources: Rice polishings, wheat bran, wheat germ, dried yeast, liver. \\nGood sources: Whole cereals, legumes, nuts and seeds, milk powder, meat, egg, leafy vegetables. \\nFair sources: Milled cereals, vegetables and fruits. \\nLong storage, canning, roasting or stewing of meat, food -processing techniques, use of alcohol are destructive to this \\nvitamin. \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and elimination: \\nAbsorption occurs primarily in the intestine (jejunum) by passive di ffusion. The vitamin is transported in blood both in \\nplasma and in red cells, mainly bound to aIbumin in plasma and hemoglobin in erythrocytes. Eighty percent of vitamin B6 is \\npresent in muscle. Excretion is through the urinary pathway. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions of  Pyridoxines:   \\n1. Formation of amines: Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxamine phosphate (PMP) are vital for the formation of \\nseveral amines that are functional in nervous tissues, for the biosynthesis of haem, formation of sp hingolipids and \\nphosphorylation of glycogen. \\n2. Growth purposes: Pyridoqal5-phosphate (PLP) is essential for growth of infants and prevents degeneration of the \\nnerves. \\n3. Coenzyme activity: Pyridoxal phosphate acts as a coenzyme. \\n4. Muscle phosphorylase: Pyridoxal phosphate is a component of muscle phosphorylase. \\n5. Dehydrases: These enzymes are vital to the catabolism of threonine, seine and homoserine and contain \\npyridoxine. \\n6. Anti-atherosclerotic effect: Vitamin B6 deficiency precipitates hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosjs. \\n7. Immune bodies: Vitamin B6 deficiency is associated with impairment in both humoral and cell mediated immunity.  \\n8. Coenzyme A synthesis: Pyridoxine is involved in the synthesis of coenzyme A from pantothenic acid.\"),\n",

The ICMR recommendations for individual intake of pyridoxine for adult males and female, is 2.0 mg per day. \\nDuring pregnancy and lactation, the recommended level of intake is2.5 gm per day. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects: \\nDeficiency:  \\nDeficiency of vitamin B6 alone is uncommon because it usually occurs in association with a deficit i n other B -complex \\nvitamins. but women who are pregnant or taking oral contraceptives may benefi t from increased intakes of this vitamin. \\nInfants are especially susceptible to insufficient intakes, which can lead to epileptic form convuls ions. Skin changes include \\ndermatitis with cheilosis and glossitis. Moreover, there is usually a decrease in circu lating lymphocytes and sometimes \\nanaemia as well. \\nToxicity: \\nVery high intakes however are dangerous.  Though toxicity related to pyridoxine intake are rare, but use of high doses of \\npyridoxine for the treatment of pre-menstrual syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome (compression of the median nerve at the \\nwrist resulting in numbness, tingling, weakness in the hand and fingers), and some neurologic diseas es has resulted in \\nneurotoxicity. An upper limit (UL) of 100 mg per day has been adopted by the FAO/WHO 2004. \\n3.2.7 B12 (Cyanobalamin) \\nVitamin B12 is a mixture of several related compounds all of rich contain the trace element cobalt.  Vitamin B,, (cobalamin, \\ncbl) is a unique vitamin in human nutrition, since its malabsorption leads to the fatal syndrome of pernicious and \\nmegaloblastic anaemia with demyelinating lesions of the central nervous system. \\n\\uf0b7 Food Sources of cyanobalamin: \\nVitamin B I2 is unique among vitamins in the sense that it is mostly found in foods of animal origin  but is not generally \\npresent in plant products. \\nRich sources: Liver (goal, sheep, ox, pig). \\nGood sources: Meal, fish, egg, kidney, brain. \\nFair sources: Fresh milk, milk powder and cheese. \\nMost microorganisims including bacteria and algae, synthesize vitamin B12,a nd they constitute the o nly source of the \\nvitamin. The vitamin BI2 synthesized in microorganisms enters the human food chain through incorporation into food of \\nanimal origin. In ma ny, animals, gastrointestinal fermentation supports the growth of these vitamin B12 synthesizing \\nmicroorganisms, and subsequently the vitamin is absorbed and incorporated into the animal tissues. This is particularly true \\nfor the liver, where vitamin B,, is stored in large concentrations. Products from herbivorous animals, such as milk, meat and \\neggs, thus constitute important dietary sources of the vitamin. Humans, therefore, derive dietary Vi tamin B12 almost \\nexclusively from animal tissues or products (i.e. milk, butter, cheese, eggs, meal, poultry). \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and elimination: \\nVitamin B12 in food is bound to proteins and is only released by the action of a high concentration of hydrochlo ric acid \\npresent in the stomach. Once released from foods, v itamin B12 absorption involves contact with two proteins: intrinsic \\nfactor (IF) and R-binder. Vitamin B12 is the only B vitamin our body can store. The average adult body contains 2 to 5 mg of \\nvitamin B12 with 80 percent of this stored in the liver.'),\n",

It  promotes the maturation of erythroid cells,  \\n2. It acts on other bone marrow elements and increases WBC and platelet count,  \\n3. It stimulates the appetite and general health of the subject,  \\n4. It cures neurological symptoms of pernicious anemia. It is involved in the manufacture of the myelin sheath, a fatty \\nlayer which insulates nerves,  \\n5. It is necessary for the production of nucleic acids, which make up DNA, the genetic  material of the cell,  \\n6. It functions as a coenzyme for enzymes methionine synthase and methybnalonyl coenzymze (CoA) mutase. \\n\\uf0b7 Recommended Dietary Allowance: \\nVitamin B12 deficiency is common in true vegans who can be treated with small doses since the daily requirement is only \\n1.0 g per day, recommendations for vitamin B12 for all age groups. However, the requirements do incr ease in lactation by \\n0.5 g per day.  \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects: \\nDeficiency: \\nBecause plants do not synthesize vitamin B 12, individuals who consume diets completely free of anim al products (vegan \\ndiets) are at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency. This is not true of lacto-ovo vegetarians, who consume the vitamin through eggs, \\nmilk and other dairy products. Persons living exclusively on vegetarian diets (vegans) have low seru m levels of vitamin B12 \\nand develop specific symptoms such as sore tongue, paraesthesia and signs of degeneration of the lon g tracts of the spinal \\ncord as a result of low intakes of vitamin B12. Megaloblastic anaemia is not so common when folic ac id intake is adequate. \\nThe anemia results from decreased DNA synthesis and failure of the cells to divide properly, coupled  with the continued \\nformation of RNA. \\nToxicity \\nIntake of 1000 pg vitamin B12 has never been reported to have any side -effects. Similar large amounts have been used in \\nsome preparations of nutritional supplements without apparent ill effects.  \\n3.2.8  Folic acid (Vitamin B9) \\nFolic acid or folate has several functions including its action with vitamin B12 in rapidly dividing cells . Folate is a generic \\nterm which includes naturally occurring food folate and folic acid in supplements and fortified food s. The term folk acid \\nrelates specifically to the fully oxidized monoglutamate form of the vitamin synthesized for commercial use in supplements \\nand fortified foods. \\n\\uf0b7 Food sources of folic acid: \\nFolate occurs naturally in foods. Although folate is found in a wide variety of foods, it is pr esent in a relatively low density \\nexcept in liver. Diets that contain adequate amounts of fresh green vegetables (i.e. in excess of tl vee servings per day) wil l \\nbe good folate sources. folate derived from animal products is subject to loss during cooking. Some staples, such as' white \\nrice are low in folate. \\nRich sources:  Liver, dried yeast, leafy vegetables, wheat germ and rice polishings. \\nGood sources:  Whole cereals, dried legumes (pulses have twice as much folic acid as cereals), nuts, fresh \\noranges, green leafy vegetables, \\n Fair sources:  Milled cereals, other vegetables, milk and fruits.\"),\n",

Following absorption, folic acid is largely reduced and methylated in the liver. Folate t ransport across \\nmembranes into cells in kidney, placenta and choroid plexus, occurs via membrane -associated folate binding proteins that \\nact as folate receptors and facilitate cellular uptake of folate. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions of  Folic acid:   \\nFolate, also known as folic acid, is essential for good health. Its functions are: \\n1. Folate is involved in the de novo synthesis of purines : synthesis of purines (adenine and guanine), requiring \\nthe folate form: Folate requiring reactions also  include those involved in phases of amino acid metabolism, \\n2. Folate specially helps in reducing the risk of heart disease  and stroke by lowering the level of the amino acid \\nhomocysteine in the blood (by forming methionine). \\n3. Folate is essential for the nervous system:  Myelin basic protein is methylated which acts as insulation for \\nnerve cells. When the methylation cycle is interrupted, as it is during vitainin B12 deficiency, one of the clinical \\nconsequences is the demyelinatioll of nerve cells resulting in a neuropathy which leads to ataxia (l ack of \\ncoordination), paralysis, and, if untreated, ultimately death. \\n4. Folate is also important for pregnant women.  Low blood levels of folate during pr egnancy can cause neural \\ntube defects-anencephaly (a defect in the closure of the neural tube) and spina bifida (a congenital defect in \\nwhich the spinal column is  imperfectly closed so that part of the meninges or spinal cord protrudes, often \\nresulting in hydrocephalus and other neurological disorders). \\n5. The dependency of methionine synthase on both folate and cobalamin explains why a single deficiency of \\neither vitamin leads to the same megaloblastic changes in the bone marrow and other tissues, with ra pidly \\ndividing cells. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Recommended Dietary Allowance: The individual requirement of folate for both the sexes recommended by ICMR is 100 \\nmcg per day, which increases during pregnancy and lactation to 400 and 150, respectively. The requirements are expressed \\nas dietary folate equivalents (DFE). One DFE is equal to 1 mcg of food folate. As natural folates are m uch less stable, \\nchemically pure folic acid (pteroylmonoglutamate) can be used to provide part of the RNI, by way of fortification or \\nsupplementation. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects: \\nDeficiency:  \\nIf there is inadequate dietary folate, the activity of both the DNA and the methylation cycles, will be reduced. A decrease in \\nthe former will reduce DNA biosynthesis and thereby reduce cell division. The deficiency will be mos t obvious in cells that \\nrapidly divide like the red blood cells, thereby producing megaloblastic anaemia characterized by la rge, abnormally \\nnucleated erythrocytes that accumulate in bone marrow. This results in an increased susceptibility t o infection, decrease in \\nblood coagulation, and intestinal malabsorption. Decrease in activity of the methylation cycle is an independent risk factor \\nfor cardiovascular disease and stroke. \\nPregnant women are at a higher risk of developing folate deficiency because of increase d demand for folate. In addition to \\nmegaloblastic anaemia, inadequate folate intake is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes like clef t lip and palate, limb \\ndeficiencies and the outflow tract defects of the heart.. Impaired folate status is associated wi th increased risk of pre-term \\ndelivery, infant low birth weight and foetal growth .and retardation. Low folate status has been ass ociated with an \\nincreased risk of colorectal cancer. Thus, it is evident that folate is very essential for good health. \\nToxicity: \\nAn upper level of 1000 yg has been prescribed. There is probably no great risk of toxicity at a rang e of intake between 400 \\nand 1000 yg of folic acid per day, with the exception of some increased difficulty in diagnosing pernicious anaemia.'),\n",

Animal products like meat, milk and meat \\nproducts, cereals and legumes are rich sources of this vitamin. Dietary deficiency of this vitamin is rare or unlikely because it \\nis so widespread in food. \\n \\n3.2.10  Biotin \\nBiotin is also essential for the metabolism of fat. Very small amounts are required and sufficient m ay well be made by the \\nbacteria normally inhabiting the large intestine. It is therefore probable  that no additional biotin be provided in the diet, \\nexcept in the very unusual situation when large quantities for raw eggs are consumed. Raw egg white contains avidin which \\ncombines with biotin making it unavailable to the body. \\nRich sources of biotin inc lude offal and egg yolk. Smaller amounts are obtained from milk and dairy products, cereals, fish, \\nfruit and vegetables. \\n \\n3.2.11 Vitamin C \\nAscorbic acid is also known as the anti -scurvy vitamin. Its chemical names are ascorbic acid and ascorbate. It is a derivative \\nof carbohydrate. \\n\\uf0b7 Food Sources \\nFood sources of vitamin C include: \\n Rich sources:   Amla and guava. \\nGood sources:  Drumstick leaves, other leafy vegetables and fruits such as cashew fruit melons, berries, pine \\napple and tomatoes. \\n  Fair sources:     Apples, banana, grapes. \\nVitamin C is found in many fruits and vegetables. Citrus fruits and juices are particularly rich sou rces of vitamin C but other \\nfruits including honeydew melons, cherries, kiwi fruits, mangoes, papaya, strawberries, tomatoes, an d water melon also \\ncontain variable amounts of vitamin C. Vegetables such as cabbage, broccoli, brussels sprouts, bean sprouts, cauliflower, \\nmustard greens, red and green peppers, peas, and potatoes may be more important sources of vitamin C  than fruits, given \\nthat the vegetable supply often extends for longer periods during the year than does the fruit supply. \\nVitamin C content of food is influenced by season, transport to market, and length of time on the sh elf and in storage, \\ncooking practices, and the ch lorination of the water used in cooking. Cutting or bruising of produce releases ascorbate \\noxidase. Blanching inactivates the oxidase enzyme and helps to preserve ascorbate, Heating and exposure to copper or iron \\nor to inildly alkaline conditions destroys the vitamin, and too much water leaches it from the tissues during cooking. \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and elimination: \\nAscorbic acid is absorbed from the intestines primarily by active transport. Simple diffusion contri butes to a small extent of \\nits absorption from the mouth and stomach. It passes through the portal vein to the general circulation and to all t issues. \\nEach organ or tissue has an optimal saturation level of ascorbic acid. It is not stored to any appre ciable extent in the body. \\nUnabsorbed vitamin C may be  metabolized by the intestinal flora. Pectin and zinc are a few substances that impair its \\nabsorption. Excess is excreted in urine. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions of    Vitamin C:   \\nThe vitamin C is involved in several physiological and biochemical functions in the body. \\n1. Enzyme function: Vitamin C acts as an electron donor for 11 enzymes out of which eight are found in humans. \\n2. Protective role as an antioxidant: Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant because it can donate a hydrogen atom and form \\na relatively stable ascorbyl free radical.'),\n",

Synthesis of hormones: Ascorbate is involved in the amidation, thereby conferring stability to hormones. \\n4. Formation of collagen and inter cellular cement substance: The vitamin is required in the formation of collagen and in \\nthe formation of intercellular cement substances for capillaries, teeth, bones etc. When the vitamin is deficient, th ese \\ntissues are not formed fully. \\n5. Absorption of iron and incorporation of plasma iron in .ferritin : A common feature of vitamin C deficiency is anemia. \\nThe antioxidant properties of vitamin C may stabilize folate in food and in plasma. Vitamin C promotes a bsorption of \\nsoluble non-haem iron. \\n6. Reduced cancel- risk: Concentrations of vitamin C appear to be high in gastric juice. Vitamin C present in gastric juice  \\nmay prevent the formation of N -nitroso compounds, which are potentially mutagenic. High intakes of vitamin C \\ncorrelate with reduced gastric cancer risk, and diets with high vitamin C content have been associat ed with lower \\ncancer risk, especially for cancers of the oral cavity, esophagus, stomach, colon and lung. \\n7. Bone formation: Ascorbate is vital for bone formation. In deficiency, though calcification is unaffected, formation of \\nbone matrix and ground substance is defective. Osteoblasts invading the area of calcification change histologically into \\nfibroblasts. The bone matrix is abnormal, as it lacks ossification. \\n8. Wound healing: Ascorbic acid deficiency delays healing of wounds, as collagen formation is affected. The rapid heal ing \\nof wounds requires the formation of strong connective tissue on the scar. \\n9. Cholesterol metabolism: vitamin C plays a protective or curative role in diseases resulting from atherosclerosis through \\nits effect on cholesterol metabolism. It protects low density lipoproteins against oxidation. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Recommended Dietary Allowance: \\nThe ICMR recommendation is 40 mg per day for both adult males and females.

The disease occurs in adults and infants . In infants scurvy is seen at the sites of most active bone growth, \\nlike  pseudo paralysis of the limbs caused by extreme pain on movement and hemorrhages as well as, s welling and \\nhemorrhages of the gums surrounding erupting teeth \\nSymptoms of scurvy in adults include: \\n1) General weakness: The first symptoms are weakness, easy fatigue and listlessness. These are followed quickly by \\nshortness of breath, pain in bones, joints and muscles of the extremities. \\n2) Swollen and tender joints and hemorrhage in various tissues: Haemorrhages occur deep in muscle, particularly in calf, \\nthigh, buttocks and forearm, causing pain in surrounding tissues. \\n3) Bleeding gums and loose teeth: As ascorbic acid deficiency advances, the gums become swollen, blue -red, spongy and \\nvery friable. They may become infected by bacteria. The teeth loosen in the alveolar bone. \\nToxicity \\nExcessive doses of vitamin C relates to intra intestinal problems and to the effects of metabolites in the urinary system. \\nIntakes of 2-3 g/day of vitamin C produce unpleasant diarrhea. Further, oxalate is an end -product of ascorbate catabolism \\nand may cause kidney stone formation. \\n3.2.12 Vitamin D \\nVitamin D is a generic term and can either be made in the skin from a cholesterol -like precursor (7-dehydrocholesterol) by \\nexposure to sunlight or can be provided pre -formed in the diet. The version made in the skin is referred to as vitamin D \\nwhereas the dietary form can be either vitamin D3 or a closely-related molecule of plant origin known as vitamin D2.'),\n",

So we have seen that it is not ju st through diet, sunlight can \\nalso help us to manufacture vitamin D. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, Storage and Elimination \\nAs we have already mentioned earlier, all fat-soluble vitamins share a common metabolic fate. Vitamin D is absorbed along \\nwith fats from the duodenum and jejunum. Bile too is essential for the effective absorption of fats and therefore of vitamin \\nD. Vitamin D formed in the skin by the  direct irradiation of the provitamin present in the skin is directly absorbed into the \\nblood stream. The vitamin is stored in concentrated quantities in the liver and to a lesser extent i n the skin, spleen, lungs , \\nbrain and kidney. The main pathway of exc retion of vitamin D is through the bile into the small intestine and consequent \\nfaecal excretion. Only less than four per cent of the intake of the vitamin is excreted by the urinary pathway. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions: Vitamin D is required to maintain normal blood levels  of calcium and phosphate, which are in turn needed for \\nthe normal mineralization of bone, muscle contraction, nerve conduction d general cellular functions in all cells of the body. \\n1. Mobilization of' bone calcium and phosphorus:  The functions of vitamin D are mediated by this vital vitamin D \\nhormone by a homeostatic mechanism which involves the hormone acting on the intestines, kidney and b one to \\nincrease serum calcium and phosphorus levels. This helps to achieve a normal blood calcium concentra tion and \\nmaintenance of calcium homeostatis. \\n2. Mineralization and .formation of  new bone: Vitamin D plays a role in the synthesis of a prominent non collagenous \\nprotein, osteocalcin, a vitamin K dependent protein found in the bone matrix and dentine - which is associate d with \\nnew bone formation. \\n3. Bone growth and development -calcification of osteoid tissue:  Vitamin D participates in metabolic processes \\nassociated with bone growth and development. It is involved in calcification of osteoid tissues. Osteoid is a protein \\nmixture which is secreted by osteoblasts. When it mineralizes, it becomes bone. \\n4. Formation of enzymcs: Vitamin D is essential for the formation of two enzymes alkaline phosphatase in the intestinal \\nlining (involved in calcium transport) and adenosine triphosphatase, (for collagen formation in bone matrix). \\n5. Regulation of amino acid levels in the blood:  Vitamin D helps to prevent loss of amino acids through the kidney and \\nthus regulate the ainino acid level and also regulate the level of citric acid in tissues and bones. \\n6. Participation in muscle formation and metabolism: Vitamin D takes part in muscle function and metabolism. \\n7. lnhibition of cancer cell proliferation and growth: Vitamin D diminishes proliferation of abnormal intestinal, lymphatic, \\nmammary and skeletal cells and provides a potential for the treatment of skin diseases such as psoriasis (a disorder in \\nwhich there is proliferation of the keratinocytes and a failure to differentiate rapidly). \\n8. Role in the immune system:  Immune responses that are mediated by T-cells can be inhibited by large doses of \\ncalcitriol. It is a natural steroid hormone formed in the healthy body as the biologically active fo rm of vitamin D. A \\ndeficiency of vitamin D also interferes with the T-cell mediated immunity. \\n9. Regulation of blood pressure: The renin-angiotensin system regulates the blood pressure. The synthesis of renin is \\ndecreased by calcitriol through its interaction with the vitamin D regulator (VDR). Inappropriate activation of the renin-\\nangiotensin system is thought to play a role in some forms of human hypertension and adequate vitamin D levels may \\nbe important for decreasing the risk of high blood pressure. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Recommended Dietary Allowances for Vitamin D \\nThe recommendations of vitamin D are expressed as IU. 1 IU is defined as  the activity contained in 0.025 m cg of \\ncholecalciferol. The recommended allowances for vitamin D as suggested by ICMR for  Indians is 200 -400 IU. A vitamin D \\nsupplement providing 400 to 800 IUs may be essential for the elderly, particularly who consume les s milk and are totally \\nhome bound.  \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects:  \\nDeficiency \\nInfants constitute a population at-risk for vitamin D deficiency because of relatively large vitamin D needs brought about by \\ntheir high rate of skeletal growth; Breastfed infants are particularly at-risk because of the low concentrations of vitamin D in \\nhuman milk. This problem is further compounded in some infants fed human milk by a restriction in exp osure to ultraviolet\"),\n",

Dietary absence of vitamin D or la ck of UV (sunlight) exposure \\ncauses the bone disease called rickets in infants and children and osteomalacia in adults. \\nToxicity \\nThe adverse effects of high vitamin D intakes include hypercalciuria (excessive urinary calcium excretion) and \\nhypercalcaemia (high concentration of calcium in blood). Excessive amounts of vitamin D are not normally available from \\ndietary sources, and hence cases of vitamin D intoxication are rare. Nevertheless, toxicity may occu r in individuals on \\nexcessive amounts of supplemented vitamins, for example, drinking milk fortified with inappropriately high levels of vitamin \\nD3. The signs and symptoms associated with it are anorexia, nausea and vomiting, followed by polyuria, p olydipsia, \\nweakness, nervousness and pruritis (itchiness). \\n3.2.12  Vitamin E \\nVitamin E is the generic term for tocopherols and tocotrienols. The tocopherols and tocotrienols occur as homologues - a, b \\nand y \\n\\uf0b7 Food Sources of Vitamin E \\nVitamin E is present in almost all foodstuffs. It is found in wheat germ, corn, nuts, seeds, olives, spinach, asparagus and \\nother green leafy vegetables and vegetable oils like groundnut, soy, cottonseed and safflower are ri ch sources. The vitamin \\nE content of edible oils is usually proportional to the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acid content of the oils. \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption and Storage of Vitamin E Absorption of vitamin E from the intestine depends on adequate pancreatic function, \\nbiliary secretion and micelle formation. Conditions for absorption are like those for dietary lipid,  that is, efficient \\nemulsification, solubilization within mixed bile salt micelles, uptake by enterocytes, and secretion  into the circulation via  \\nthe lymphatic system. Emulsification takes place initially in the stomach and then in the small inte stine in the presence of \\npancreatic and biliary secretions. Tocopherol esters, present in processed foods and vitamin supplem ents, must be \\nhydrolyzed in the small intestine before absorption. \\nVitamin E is transported in the blood by the plasma lipoproteins and erythrocytes. F rom a nutritional perspective, the most \\nimportant form of vitamin E is a -tocopherol. It is absorbed faster and retained better than other forms. T11is is due to the \\naction of binding proteins that preferentially select the a form over other forms. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions of Vitamin E  \\nVitamin E is the major lipid -soluble antioxidant in the cell antioxidant defense system and is exclusively obtained from the \\ndiet. The main role of vitamin E and the biological activity of tocopherols are due to its antioxida nt property. Th is \\nantioxidant property of vitamin E is useful for various body processes and substances. \\n1. Protection of poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) from oxidative damage:  The major biological role of vitamin E is to \\nprotect PUFAs and other components of cell membr anes and low -density lipoprotein &DL) from oxidation by free \\nradicals.  \\n2. Protection of erythrocytes: Vitamin E protects erythrocytes from haemolysis by the production of oxidizing agents e.g. \\ndialuric acid and hydrogen peroxide. \\n3. Protection of cell membrane: It protects the cell membrane from getting damaged from naturally occurring peroxides \\nand toxic free radicals formed from fatty acids and oxidative tissue damage as described above. \\n4. Protection against poisoning: It protects liver from injury due to carbon tetrachloride poisoning. \\n5. Protection of both vitamin A and carotene : It protects vitamin A and p -carotene from destruction by oxidation, \\nespecially in the alimentary tract, thus sparing the supply of vitamin A available to the body. \\n6. Synthesis of enzymes and proteins: It serves as a co -repressor in the synthesis of certain enzymes and plays a specific \\nrole in the synthesis of haem proteins. \\n7. Protection of mitochondria: It protects the mitochondria1 function of the muscles and cardiac tissue. Tocopherol acts \\nas an electron acceptor in the electron transport system and prevents the disruption of mitochondria.'),\n",

Reduction in free radical generation: Vitamin E acts synergistically with selenium thereby reducing susceptibility of LDL \\nlo oxidation, free radical generation and membrane damage. This antioxidant role of vitamin E together with selenium \\nprotects against cardiovascular diseases especially atherosclerotic lesions. \\n9. Regulation of enzyme activities: Vitamin E regulates the activity of enzymes, a-aminole vulinic acid (AL4) synthetase in \\nbone marrow and ALA dehydrase in liver, \\n10. Prevention of diseases:  Because of its anti -oxidant function and its role in inhibiting cell proliferation of smooth \\nmuscles, vitamin E can be used for prevention and treatme nt of diseases. Epidemiological studies suggest that dietary \\nvitamin E influences the risk of cardiovascular disease. It has also been suggested that vitamin E supplementation (200-\\n400 mg/day) may be appropriate therapeutically to moderate some aspects of degenerative diseases such as Parkinson \\ndisease, reduce the severity of neurologic disorders such as tardive dyskinesia (potentially irreversible and involuntary \\nmovements), prevent periventricular haemorrhage in pre-term babies, reduce tissue injury arising from ischaernia and \\nreperfusion during surgery, delay cataract development, and improve mobility in arthritis sufferers. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Recommended Dietary Allowances for Vitamin E \\nThe requirements for the vitamin E are expressed in terms of tocopherol equivalents (T E) as mentioned earlier - 8 mg for \\nfemales and 10 mg for males. It has been seen that the adequacy of RDA varies with PUFA content significantly; increased \\nintakes necessitate larger amounts of vitamin E in the diet. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects \\nDeficiency: \\nVitamin E deficiency in human is extremely rare. This may probably be due to its wide occurrence in natural foods. Evidence \\nof deficiency is however seen in individuals with chronic fat malabsorption. Vitamin E deficiency is  a cause of the impaired \\nneuromuscular fun ction, sometimes seen in patients with disorders that interfere with absorption or transport of the \\nvitamin. Symptoms include poor reflexes, impaired locomotion, decreased sensation in the hands and f eet, and changes in \\nthe retina. \\nWe read about the consequences of low intake of vitamin E on the human body. \\n Toxicity:  \\nA very high intake of vitamin E can also elicit severe adverse reactions, as described next. Vitamin  E is relatively non -toxic. \\nAdults tolerate doses as high as 100 to 1,000 IU per day. Howev er, adverse effects such as muscle weakness, fatigue, \\nnausea, diarrhea, double vision, elevation of serum lipids, impaired blood coagulation and reduction  of serum thyroid \\nhormones occur due to indiscriminate ingestion of excessive amounts of vitamin E over long periods of time. \\n3.2.13  Vitamin K \\nVitamin K is an essential fat-soluble micronutrient;  its role in health is in the maintenance of normal coagulation. \\n\\uf0b7 Food sources of Vitamin K \\nThe only important molecular 'form of vitamin K is phylloquinone. Phylloquinone is distributed ubiquitously throughout the \\ndiet, and the ange of concentrations in different food categories is very wide. In general, the highest values (normally in the \\nrange 400-700 mg / 100 g) are found in green leafy vegetables (such as spinach, cauliflower, cabbage and lettuce). The next \\nbest sources are certain vegetable oils (e.g. soybean, rapeseed and olive), which contain 50 -200 mg/100g, other vegetable \\noils, such as peanut, corn, sunflower and safflower, however, contain much lower amou nts of phylloquinone (1-10 mg/100 \\ng). Other good sources include animal foods such as egg yolk, milk and organ meats like liver. \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, Storage and Elimination of Vitamin K \\nDietary vitamin K, mainly phylloquinone, is absorbed chemically unchanged from  the proximal intestine after solubilization \\ninto mixed micelles composed of bile salts and the products of pancreatic lipolysis. Vitamin K is stored in the liver, - the site \\nof synthesis of coagulation proteins.\"),\n",

Vitamin K is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted in \\nthe urine and bile. About 60 -70% of the amount of' phylloquinone absorbed from each meal will ultimately be lost to the \\nbody by excretion. This, therefore, suggests that the body stores of phylloquinone are being constantly replenished. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions of Vitamin K \\nThe functions of vitamin K are both physiological and biochemical. These include: \\n1) Blood coagulation: The primary function of vitamin K in the body is in the maintenan ce of normal blood coagulation. \\nThe vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins are synthesized in the liver and comprise Factor IT (prothrombin), Factor \\nVII (proconvertin), Factor IX (Christmas factor) and Factor X (Stuart factor), which have a haemostatic r ole i.e. they are \\nprocoagulants that arrest and prevent bleeding. \\n2) Vitamin K-dependent carboxylation: Vitamin K acts as a cofactor in the synthesis of y carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) from \\nglutamic acid residues required for the normal coagulation of blood. \\n3) Vitamin K dependent proteins: The four vitamin K-dependent procoagulant (factor 11 or prothrombin, and factors VII, \\nIX, and X), about which we studied above, are serine proteases that are synthesized in the liver and then secreted into \\nthe circulation as inac tive forms (zymogens). Two other vitamin K -dependent proteins, protein C and protein S, play a \\nregulatory role in the inhibition of coagulation. \\n4) Prevents bone loss: Vitamin K is known to inhibit bone loss through inhibiting effect on osteoblast formation. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Recommended Dietary Allowances \\nRecommended dietary intakes have not been suggested for different age groups or gender. The safe lev els of intake is 80 \\nmcg for adult males and 65 mcg for adult females. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects \\nVitamin K in excess or low intakes can have serious implications on human health. Although such conditions are rare, they \\ncan often be life-threatening. Vitamin K deficiency leads to a lowered prothrombin level and increased clotting time, which \\ncould lead to hemorrhages. The population groups that appear most at risk for vitamin K deficiency are newborn infants \\nand people who have been injurecl and have renal insufficiency. The increased risk for infants fed on human milk compared \\nwith formula milk is probably related to the relatively low conc entrations of vitamin K (phylloquinone) in breast milk \\ncompared with formula milks. \\nRefer to tables 3.2.1 to 3.2.11 for ICMR RDIs of vitamins for Indians \\n3.3          Classification of Minerals, its sources, digestion, absorption, functions and nutritional requirement \\nWe have already learnt that minerals or inorganic elements are necessary for the optimal functioning  of the human body. \\nMinerals have three major functions: \\na) As constituents of the bones and teeth. These include calcium, phosphorus and magnesium. \\nb) As soluble salts which help to control the composition of the body fluids and cells. These include s odium and \\nchlorine in the fluids outside the cells ex. Blood and potassium, magnesium and phosphorus inside the cells. \\nc) As essential adjuncts to many enzymes and other proteins such as hemoglobin which are necessary for the release \\nand utilization of energy. Iron and phosphorus act in this way along with other elements. \\nThese seven elements are in general needed in the greatest amounts in the diet a nd are present in the largest amounts in \\nthe body tissues together with sulphur and are thus considered as major minerals. The remainders are equally essential but \\nneeded in small quantities and are called trace elements. Excess of most of these can be poisonous. \\n3.3.1 Calcium \\nAmong minerals, calcium (Ca) is most abundantly present in humans, representing 52% of the body's mi neral content and \\namounting to 1.2% of body weight. In the elementary composition of the human body, calcium ranks fif th after oxygen,\"),\n",

Nearly all (99%) of total  body calcium is \\nlocated in the skeleton together with more than three quarters of the body’s phosphorus. The remaini ng 1 % is equally \\ndistributed between the teeth and soft tissues, with only 0.1% in the extracellular fluid (ECF). \\n\\uf0b7 Food sources of Calcium: \\nDairy products are of course the primary source of calcium followed by grains and pulses. Among the millets, ragi contains a \\ngood amount of calcium. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions: \\nCalcium salts provide rigidity to the skeleton and calcium ions play a role in many if not most, met abolic processes. An \\nunderstanding of the role of calcium in skeletal structures requires that the process of bone format ion and mineralization \\nbe clearly comprehend. Bone is unique living tissue as it is rigid and strong and at the same time light e nough to be moved \\nby coordinated muscle contractions. There are two types of bones: the cortisone, densely packed mineralized collagen laid \\ndown in layers a nd the ti+nbecullal bone (cancellous bones), which is spongy and provides strength and elasticity. In \\naddition to the structural role in bones, Ca also performs other functions in the body. These functions include:  \\n1) Clotting of blood  \\n2) Nerve conduction \\n3) Muscle contraction \\n4) Enzyme regulation \\n5) Membrane permeability \\nIonized Ca is chiefly involved in these functions. As the levels of serum total and ionic calcium ar e tightly controlled, these \\nfunctions are well regulated. Bone mineral serves as the ultimate reservoir for the calcium. \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and excretion: \\nCalcium (Ca) in food occurs as calcium salts e.g. calcium phosphate or is associated with other diet ary constituents e.g. \\ncalcium caseinate in milk. Before absorption, Ca must be released from foods and solubilized. This is achieved by the \\ncombined actions of gastric acid, intestinal enzymes, intestinal contractions and peristalsis. When calcium intake is low, \\ncalcium is mainly absorbed by active (transcellular) transport, but at higher intakes, an in creasing proportion of calcium is \\nabsorbed by simple (paracellular) diffusion. Thus, calcium is absorbed from the intestine by transce llular route and \\nparacellular route. \\nNot more than 4% (8 mg) of dietary Ca is absorbed by the colon per day. The unabsorbe d component which appears in the \\nfeces together with the unabsorbed component of digestive juice calcium is known as endogenous fecal calcium. The feces, \\ntherefore, contain unabsorbed dietary calcium and digestive juice calcium that was not reabsorbed.  Calcium is also \\nexcreted approximately in equal amounts in urine and through intestinal secretions. Bile and other s ecretions into the \\nintestine account for 150 mg calcium per day of which 30% is reabsorbed. Losses through skin, hair a nd nails also need to \\nbe taken into account (insensible losses). Sweat losses are minimal, about 15 mg/day. Total calcium los s may thus amount \\nto 350 mg/day. \\nWe must remember the fact that the amount of calcium that we eat need not be the amount of calcium that gets absorbed. \\nSeveral factors affect the proportion of dietary calcium absorbed by humans, also known as fractional absorption of dietary \\ncalcium. Age is one factor which influences the absorption of calcium. Fractional absorption of calcium is highes t in infancy \\n@ 6O%, fo llowed by the early pubertal period. Absorption of calcium is also increased in pregnancy to levels higher than \\n25% reported in adults. Available data suggests that in post menopausal women, absorption declines by 0.21% every year. \\nThus, from 50 years Lo 7 0 years, absorption may decline by 4%. Food is another factor. Calcium is poorly absorbed from \\nfoods that are rich in oxalic acid or phytic acid. Phytates, present in the husk of many cereals, as  well as, in nuts, seeds, and \\nlegumes, can form insoluble calcium phytate salts in the gastrointestinal tract. Excess oxalates can precipitate calcium in the \\nbowel. In comparison to calcium absorption from milk, calcium absorption from phytic acid rich grain s is one half and from \\nspinach it is only one tenth. This is so because spinach is high in oxalic acid. Majority of the calcium absorbed is stored in the \\nbones/skeletal tissues.'),\n",

The RDA for Indian adult male is based on replacing the losses of calcium in urine, stools, bile and sweat, which \\nis estimated to be 700 mg calcium per day. The fractional absorption in adults is taken to be 20 -30% in the presence of \\nadequate vitamin D. Additional calcium for growth, pregnancy and lactation are calculated separately. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects: \\nDeficiency \\nIf there is a continued inadequate intake or poor intestinal absorption of calcium, plasma calcium c oncentrations will be \\nmaintained from increased bone resorption. The cumulative effect of calcium depletion on the skeleto n over many years \\ncontributes to the increasing frequency of fractures with age. Prolonged inadequate calcium intake in young growing \\nchildren with red~~cthee rate of accretion of the skeleton and may prevent the attainment of the gen etically determined \\nmaximal bone mass. In extreme cases, Ca deficiency can give rise to rickets in children. \\nCalcium and Osteoporosis: Accelerated bone loss with age is a consistent finding in both women and men. It occurs earlier \\nin women than in men as decreased estrogen production in menopause is associated with accelerated bone loss in women, \\nestimated at 3% per year in the first five years after menopause. The effectiveness of calcium supplements in retard ing \\nbone loss in post menopausal women is not entirely settled. However, clinical trials in this area seem to indicate that \\nsupplements of calcium can have beneficial effect in slowing the rate of bone loss in post menopausal women. \\nCalcium and Hypertension: Chronic inadequate intake of calcium may play some role in etiologies of hypertension.  Calcium \\ndeficiency has been linked to hypertension \\nToxicity \\nElevated blood calcium can occur in association with high parathyroid hormone, hyper - or hypothyroid conditions, bone \\nmetastasis, vitamin D toxicity, excess intake or absorption of calcium, Addis on's disease and with thiazide diuretics. High \\nblood calcium may be asymptomatic or can cause constipation, nausea and vomiting, increased urinatio n, thirst, muscle \\nweakness, kidney failure, irritability, confusion, psychosis and coma. The role of calcium supplements in eliciting \\nhypercalcaemia has always been under scrutiny. Since the efficiency of absorption from large doses i s poor, no adverse \\neffects have been found with calcium supplements providing up to 2400 mg/day. However, at such high levels, iron  \\nabsorption is reduced and risk of iron deficiency increases. A practical suggestion would be not to consume high dose of \\ncalcium with meals that provide most of the iron. Supplements of calcium do not carry the risk for r enal stones in ilorinal \\nindividuals but can increase the risk in patients with renal hypercaliuria. In fact, it has been suggested tha t dietary calcium \\nmay protect against renal calculi because it binds dietary oxalate and reduces oxalate excretion. An  upper limit on calcium \\nintake of 3 g daily is recommended by the FAO/WHO 2004. \\n Refer to table no.3.1 for ICMR RDIS for calcium for Indians \\n3.3.2  Phosphorus \\nPhosphorus is the second most abundant element in the human body, comprising 30% of the total minera l content. An \\nadult human body cont ains approximately 600 g of phosphorus. Most phosphorus like Ca (as calcium phosphate) is stored \\nin the bone and teeth in an inorganic metal state . The remaining 15% is distributed in soft tissues in both organic and \\ninorganic form. Phosphates play an esse ntial role in the liberation and utilization of energy from food. They are also \\nconstituents of nucleic acids and some fats, proteins and carbohydrates and must be combined with B-vitamins in the body \\nbefore the latter can be active. \\n\\uf0b7 Food sources of Phosphorus \\nPhosphorus is widely distributed in food.

In \\nmilk, 33% is in the inorganic form. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions: \\nDistribution of phosphorus in body clearly explains that it functions as a structural  component, as well as, has a role in \\nmetabolic reactions. \\nInorganic Phosphorus: The major functions of inorganic phosphorus include:  \\n1) Structural component of bones and teeth: Phosphorus is a part of calcium phosphate in various crystalline. Ca forms \\nrequired for ossification. \\n2) Acid-base balance: Within cells, phosphate is the main intracellular buffer. \\n     Organic Phosphorus: It is involved in the following reactions/components:  \\n1) Structural component of nucleic acids: It is important component of DNA and RNA.   \\n2) Components of cell membrane: Phospholipids with their polar and non polar regions are important for the bi layer \\nstructure of cell membranes. \\n3) Phosphorus is of vital importance in intermediary metabolism of the energy nutrients contributing to  temporar y \\nstorage and transfer of energy. \\n4) Component of coenzymes like NADP, TPP, PLP, coenzyme A, FAD, NAD \\n5) Many enzymatic activities are controlled by alternating phosphorylation or dephosphorylation. Thus, it is required in \\nregulating metabolism. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and excretion: \\nAs you have seen that food contains both organic and inorganic phosphorus, but most of it is absorbed in its inorganic form. \\nTherefore, organically bound phosphorous is hydrolyzed in the lumen by intestinal phosphatases. However, org anic \\nphosphate of phytic acid may not be available. Phosphorus absorption occurs throughout the small int estine, although \\nduodenum and jejunum are important sites. Phosphorus absorption is efficient -60-70%. Ingestion of antacids containing \\nmagnesium or aluminum hydroxide can interfere with phosphorus absorption. \\nIt is important to note that unlike calcium, absorption efficiency of phosphorus does not increase o n low intake nor any \\nadaptive mechanism is available for the same. Most phosphorus is absorbed by passive concentration dependent process. \\nUnabsorbed phosphorus is excreted in feces. Excretion of endogenous phosphorus is mainly through kidney. \\n\\uf0b7 Nutritional requirement and RDA for Phosphorus \\nThe requirements of phosphorus are closely linked with those of  calcium. Phosphate requirements are fully met usually \\nwhen diets provide adequate calcium as these two minerals generally occur together in foods. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects \\nSituations' may develop when the phosphate levels in blood and other tissues may increase or decrease beyond normal \\nlevels. Such disturbances in the phosphorus levels may develop with or without any effects in the calcium metabolism. \\nDeficiency \\nInadequate phosphorus intake results in abnormally low serum phosphate levels (hypophosphatemia).

Such calcium phosphate deposition can lead to organ damage, especially \\nkidney damage. \\n3.3.3  Magnesium \\nAfter calcium, and potassium,Magnesium (Mg) is found in abundance in body but it is the least abunda nt among macro \\nminerals, the total amount in the body  being 25 g. Like Ca and P, this mineral is also present in the bones but unlike them \\nwhich constitute 99% and 85% of the bones, only 55 -60% of total magnesium is located in the skeleton. Another 20 -25% is \\nfound in muscles with remaining in other soft tiss ues. Only 1% of total body magnesium is extracellular. Magnesium is \\nclosely associated with cells and is second to potassium in abundance in cells. \\n\\uf0b7 Food sources: \\nMagnesium is widely distributed in variety of foods and beverages. In plants it is associated with chlorophyll. Thus, green \\nleafy vegetables are excellent sources of magnesium. Most green vegetables, legume seeds, beans, tea , coffee, cocoa and \\nnuts are rich in magnesium, as are some shellfish, spices, and soya flour, all of which usually cont ain more than 500 mg/kg \\nfresh weight. Although most unrefined cereal grains are reasonable sources, many highly -refined flours, tubers, fruits and \\nmost oils and fats contribute little dietary magnesium (<100m g/kg fresh weight).  Refining of whole cereals can red uce the \\nmagnesium content by 80%. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions: Like Ca, Mg too has a role in bone formation. Soft tissue magnesium functions as a cofactor of many enzymes \\ninvolved in energy metabolism, protein synthesis, RNA and DNA synthesis, and maintenance of the elec trical potential of \\nnervous tissues and cell membranes. \\n1) Between 50% and 60% of body magnesium is located within bone, where it is thought to form a surface \\nconstituent of the hydroxyapatite (calcium phosphate) mineral component. \\n2) Within cells, Mg is bound to phospholipids of the cell membrane (plasma, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum). It \\nhelps in membrane stabilization. \\n3) Mg is responsible for the structural integrity of the subunits forming ribosome. It also maintains d ouble helical \\nstructure of DNA. \\n4) Intracellular free Mg+2 regulate ion movements. \\n5) Mg is vital for energy production as it is required b-y ATP synthesizing protein in the mitochondria. \\n6) As intracellular component, it is essential for different enzyme reactions, as structural cofactor o r an alloster ic \\nactivator of enzyme activity. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and excretion: \\nMagnesium absorption to some extent is similar to that of Ca. Absorption of Mg occurs throughout the  small intestine, \\nalthough jejunum and ileum are important sites. It crosses the intest inal membrane by both active transport and passive \\ndiffusion. Colon may also play a role in its absorption. About 30 -65% of dietary Mg is absorbed in healthy adults. Like Ca, \\nabsorption of Mg is also more efficient when its status is marginal or intake is low. High intake of dietary fiber  (40-50 g/day) \\nlower magnesium absorption. This is probably attributable to the magnesium -binding action  of phytate phosphorus \\nassociated with the fibre. However, consumption of phytateand  cellulose-rich products increases  magnesium intake (as \\nthey usually contain high concentrations of magnesium) which often compensates for the decrease in absorption. Lactose, \\nfructose and protein appear to increase its absorption. Magnesium homeostasis is maintained chiefly by controlling its \\nexcretion through urine. The kidney has a very significant role in magnesium homeostasis. Active rea bsorption of \\nmagnesium takes place in the Loop of Henle in the proximal convoluted tubule. About 70% of serum Mg is filtered by \\nkidney, but 95% of this  is reabsorbed by a healthy kidney. Regulation of Mg homeostasis occurs chiefly through renal \\nexcretion.'),\n",

No specific recommendation is made by ICMR for Mg intakes in Indians. However, the FA O/WHO 2004 \\nrecommended nutrient intake for magnesium as 220 and 260 mg magnesium per day for adult females and males, \\nrespectively whereas no increment for pregnancy but around 50 mg/day increment for lactation. \\nHealth aspects \\nDeficiency \\nDeficiency of magnesium is rare for two reasons: firstly, the mineral is widely distributed in the f oods; secondly, kidney is  \\nable to adjust re-absorption of filtered magnesium to body needs. Studies have shown that a decline in urinary magnesium \\nexcretion during protein energy malnutrition (PEM) is accompanied by a reduced intestinal absorption  of magnesium. The \\ncatch-up growth associated with recovery from PEM is achieved only if magnesium supply is increased substantially. \\nToxicity \\nExcessive intake of Mg is not likely to cause toxicity except in people with impaired renal function . Excessive intakes of Mg \\nsalts such as MgSO4 can lead to diarrhea. \\n3.3.4 Sodium, Potassium and Chloride \\nThese  three macro minerals, Na, K and Cl are related to each other and hence will be discussed toge ther, which makes it \\neasier to appreciate their roles in metabolism. Sodium and potassium are monovalent cations (ions th at carry a positive \\ncharge) while chloride is a monovalent anion (ions that carry a negative charge). All three are known as electrolytes as their \\nions are used for generating electric charge differences across the plasma membrane of most cells. Na constitutes 2%; K 5% \\nand C1 3% of the total mineral content of the body. These minerals exist as ions in the body fluids and are principal \\nelectrolytes in the body. Potassium is a major intracellular electrolyte while sodium and chloride a re present in the \\nextracellular fluids. \\n\\uf0b7 Food sources: \\nCommon salt added to our food in the form of sodium chloride is the major source of sodium and chlor ide. Naturally \\noccurring sources of sodium are milk, meats, eggs and most vegetables. In addition, food additives u sed in processed foods \\nsuch as baking powder, preservatives etc. contribute towards dietary sodium intake. Therefore, it is  important to take note \\nof all these while calculating the sodium content of diets, On the other hand, potassium is abundant  in unprocessed foods, \\nfruits, many vegetables and fresh meats. Also many salt substitutes contain potassium instead of sodium. \\nFunctions: \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and excretion: \\nAll these three elements are readily absorbed from the small intestine with almost 90 -100% efficiency. They are excreted \\nprimarily via urine, although feces and sweat are other sources of elimination. It is important to note that profuse sweating \\ncan result in substantial losses of these elements. Potassium is absorbed in the.smal1 intestine as a consequence o f bulk \\nfluid absorption. \\nBoth sodium and potassium are absorbed in the distal colon. Renal excretion and retention of these e lements is closely \\nregulated. The total content of body sodium especially the concentration in the extracellular fluid (ECF) is und er \\nhomeostatic control. The regulation of chloride is achieved indirectly through sodium regulation. Li ke sodium, the \\nmaintenance of K balance also depends on the kidney. Unlike sodium, the transport of K is bi-directional during the passage \\nof the filtrate through nephrons. In the proximal tubule and loop of Henle, major portion of filtered K is reabsor bed. In the \\ndistal tubule, it can be reabsorbed from the filtrate or can be secreted into it depending on the bo dy's need. Aldosterone \\nacts reciprocally on Na and K. This hormone stimulates sodium reabsorption, but it accelerates the secretion of potassium  \\nand thus increases its excretion. It is important to note that body's ability to conserve sodium by restricting loss in the urine \\nis more efficient than it s ability to conserve potassium. Also, sodium is absorbed more efficiently from the gastrointestinal  \\nthan potassium. Therefore, potassium deficiency will appear before sodium deficiency.\"),\n",

It is an organic compound essential in minute amounts for the growth and \\nhealth of an an imal. Like macro minerals, micro minerals must also be present in the body in optimal range for normal \\nfunctioning. Whenever, the concentration is too low or too high, body functions are impaired. Knowledge of the exact roles \\nand dietary requirements for t hese minerals is incomplete as some of them have been recently found to be essential, for \\nsome their dietary deficiencies are unknown and for some the utilization of them in the body may be affected by the \\namount of other elements present.   \\n3.3.5.1  IRON \\nIron is one of the most investigated minerals in nutrition. We associate iron with its presence in b lood and that its \\ndeficiency results in low hemoglobin levels and hence anemia. In humans, the total quantity of iron in the body varies with \\nhemoglobin concentration, body weight, gender and the amount of iron stored in various tissues. Healthy adults con tain \\nabout 3 to 4gm of iron more than half of which is in the form of hemoglobin, the red pigment of bloo d. Iron is also present \\nin the muscle protein myoglobin and is stored to some extent in organs such as the liver. \\n\\uf0b7 Food sources of Iron: \\nIron is found in foods in one of the two forms i.e. haem or non-haem. In the human diet, the primary sources of hem iron \\nare the hemoglobin and myoglobin from consumption of meat, poultry and fish whereas non -hem iron is obtained from \\ndried apricots, raisins, cereals, pulses, legumes, fruits and vegetables. Dietary non -hem iron accounts for about 85% of the \\ntotal iron intake even among non-vegetarians. \\nFunctions: \\nIron has s everal vital functions in the body. It serves as a carrier of oxygen to the tissues from the lungs b y red blood cell \\nhemoglobin, as a transport medium for electrons within cells, and as an integrated part of important  enzyme systems in \\nvarious tissues. The general classification of the reactions in which iron is involved includes: \\n\\uf0a7 Oxygen transport and storage \\n\\uf0a7 Electron transfer \\n\\uf0a7 Substrate oxidation- reduction\"),\n",

However, for iron to perform any funct ion, it first needs to be \\ntaken up by the cells.  Cell membranes contain a protein specific for binding transferrin called 'transferrin receptor'. \\nTransferrin containing two ferric ions, binds to this receptor. Within the cell, iron is released from transferrin. \\nAs a part of hemoglobin, iron is required for the transport of oxygen, to all cells in the body. Thu s, hemoglobin is critical for \\ncell respiration. Most of the iron in the body is present in the erythrocytes as hemoglobin, a molec ule composed of four \\nunits, each containing one hem group and one protein chain. The structure of hemoglobin allows it to  be fully loaded with \\noxygen in the lungs and partially unloaded in the tissues  like in the muscles.The  iron-containing oxygen storage protein in \\nthe muscles, myoglobin, is similar in structure to hemoglobin but has only one haem unit and one globin chain. As \\nmyoglobin, iron functions as a ready source of oxygen to the muscles. \\nHence Iron is thus crucial for the survival, growth and normal functioning of the human system. \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and excretion: \\nLike other minerals, we obtain iron from the diet, which is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. A unique feature of iron \\nmetabolism is that the body re utilizes quantitatively the iron released from the degradation of erythrocytes, with very little \\nbeing excreted. Hence, it is very frequently mentioned that once iron enters the body, the body holds on to it tenaciously. \\nBefore it can be absorbed, iron whether it is in the form of haem or non -haem, must be released from the food matrices \\nwhere it is bond with other constituents. Proteases (the enzyme) in the stomach and small intestine hydrolyze haem iron \\nfrom the globin portion of haemoglobin or myoglob in. In the case of non -haem iron, gastric secretion including HCl and \\npepsin aid its release from food components. Most non -haem iron is present in the ferric form which is reduced to ferrous \\nform in the acidic environment of the stomach. \\nThe body has thre e unique mechanisms for maintaining iron balance. The first is the continuous reutilization of iron from \\ncatabolized erythrocytes in the body. The second mechanism involves access to the specific storage p rotein, ferritin. This \\nprotein stores iron in perio ds of relatively low need and releases it to meet excessive iron demands. This iron reservoir is \\nespecially important in the third trimester of pregnancy. The third mechanism involves the regulatio n of absorption of iron \\nfrom the intestines; decreasing bod y iron stores trigger increased iron absorption and increasing iron stores trigger \\ndecreased iron absorption. Iron absorption decreases until equilibrium is established between absorption and requirement. \\nTransferrin is a glycoprotein and has two binding sites for Fe3+. It acts as an iron transport protein. Normally, in plasma it is \\none-third saturated with ferric ions. It distributes iron throughout the body to wherever it is needed, mostly to erythrocyte \\nprecursors in the bone marrow. Any absorbed iron in excess of body needs is stored in the liver, in two forms, as ferritin \\nand haemosiderin. Ferritin and haemosiderin are the two major iron storage proteins. Our body has a limited capacity t o \\nexcrete iron once it has been absorbed. Daily losses in adult man are between 0.9 to 1.05 mg. About 0.08 mg is lo st via \\nurine, 0.2 mg via skin, and remaining in the feces. Women in the reproductive age lose more iron owing to menstrual cycles. \\nNutritional requirement and RDA for Iron: \\nThe requirements for iron, as recommended by ICMR, for various age -groups, are based on iron absorption of 3% in adult \\nmen, adolescent boys and children; 5% in adult women, adolescent girls, lactating women, and 8% in pregnant women. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects: \\nDeficiency \\nIron deficiency is one of the most prevalent nutritional deficiencies in the world today. It is esti mated that 2 billion people \\nworldwide suffer from different degrees of iron deficiency, about half of them, manifesting iron def iciency anemia. Iron \\ndeficiency and iron deficiency anemia are often incorrectly used as synonyms. Iron deficiency is defined as a hemoglobin \\nconcentration below the optimum value in an individual, whereas iron deficiency anemia implies that the hemoglobin \\nconcentration is below the 95th percentile o f the distribution of hemoglobin concentration in a population. \\nThe progression from adequate iron status to iron deficiency anemia develops in three overlapping stages. The first stage is \\ndepletion of storage i ron with serum ferritin levels starting to decline. However, the transferrin saturation, erythrocyte  \\nprotoporphyrin and hemoglobin are within normal limits. As iron stores get increasingly depleted, ir on deficiency develops\"),\n",

During this stage, in addition to low serum ferritin levels, transferrin saturation is also reduced \\nand erythrocyte protoporphyrin is elevated. Hemoglobin may be normal. Eventually when iron deficienc y progresses to \\nanemia, hemoglobin levels start declining; this is the third and final stage of iron deficiency. \\nThe functional effects of iron deficiency anemia result from both a reduction in circulating hemoglo bin and a reduction in \\niron-containing enzymes and myoglobin. \\nThese include: \\n\\uf0b7 fatigue, restlessness and impaired work performance, \\n\\uf0b7 disturbance in thermoregulation, \\n\\uf0b7 impairment of certain key steps in immune response, \\n\\uf0b7 adverse effects on psychomotor and mental development particularly in children, \\n\\uf0b7 Increased maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. \\nIn humans, about 10% of brain-iron is present at birth; at the age of 10 years, the brain has only reached half its normal iron \\ncontent and optimal amounts are first reached between the ages of 20 and 30 years. Several groups ha ve demonstrated a \\nrelationship between iron deficiency and attention, memory and learning in infants and small children. 70% or more of the \\npre-school children, 90% or more of pregnant women and adolescent girls suffer from either iron deficien cy or iron \\ndeficiency anemia in India. T he serious functional effects of iron deficiency anemia on learning, cognition and physical \\nperformance in children and productivity in adults, as well as, increased maternal 'and pre -natal mortality in pregnant \\nwomen make it imperative to prevent and or t reat iron deficiency as a priority. There is a major National programme, the \\nNational Nutritional Anemia Control  Programme that aims to prevent and treat anemia in pregnant women using a public \\nhealth approach. Iron (100 mg elemental iron) and folic acid ( 0.5 mg) in the form of tablets are provided to all pregnant \\nwomen for 100 days during a pregnancy through the ICDS. Nutritional iron deficiency implies that the  diet cannot supply \\nenough iron to coves the body's physiological requirements for this mineral.  Worldwide, this is the most common cause of \\niron deficiency. In many tropical countries, infestations with hookworms lead to intestinal blood lo sses that in some \\nindividuals can be considerable. \\nToxicity: \\nAn excessive body burden of iron can be produced by greater -than-normal absorption from the alimentary canal, by \\nparenteral injection or by a combination of both. For instance, people with genetic defects develop iron overload as it \\noccurs in idiopathic hemochromatosis. It is a hereditary disorder of iron metabolism  characterized by abnormally high iron \\nabsorption owing to a failure of the iron  absorption control mechanism at the intestinal level. High deposits of iron in the \\nliver and the heart can lead to cirrhosis, hepatocellular cancer, congestive heart failure and eventual death. \\n \\nRefer to Table no.3.3.5.1 for ICMR RDIs of iron for Indians \\n3.3.5.2 ZINC \\nZinc is present in all body tissues and fluids. The total body zinc content has been estimated to be  30 mmol or 2 g. Skeletal \\nmuscle accounts for approximately 60% of the total body content and bone mass, with a zinc concentra tion of \\napproximately 30%. The concentration of zinc in lean body mass is approximately 0.46 mmol/g .Plasma zinc has a rapid \\nturnover rate and it represents only about 0.1% of total body zinc content. This level appears to be under close homeostatic \\ncontrol. High concentrations of zinc are found in the choroid of the eye (4.2 mmol/g) and in prostat ic fluids (4.6-7.7 mmol/l \\nor 300 -500 mg/L). \\n\\uf0b7 Food sources of Zinc: \\nZinc is normally associated with the protein and or nucleic acid fraction of foods. \\nThus, foods high in proteins are good sources of zinc. Lean red meat, whole -grain cereals, pulses and legumes provide the \\nhighest concentration s of zinc: concentrations in such foods are generally in the range of 25 -50 mg/kg of raw weight. \\nProcessed cereals with low extraction rates, polished rice, and chicken, pork or meat with high fat content have moderate \\nzinc content, typically between 10 and 25 mg/kg. Fish, roots and tubers, green leafy' vegetables, and fruits are only modest\"),\n",

Saturated fats and oils, sugar and alcohol have v ery low zinc contents. \\nZinc is present in high amounts in nuts and r ed meat. Among seafood, oysters are very high in zinc. Other good animal \\nsources include poultry, pork and dairy products. Among the foods of plant origin, legumes, whole gr ain cereals and \\nvegetables (leafy vegetables and roots) are the good sources. Refining of cereals reduce the content to a large extent. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions: \\nZinc is an essential component of a large number of enzymes participating in the synthesis and degradation of \\ncarbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids, as well as, in the metabolism o f other micronutrients. Zinc stabilizes the \\nmolecular structure of cellular components and membranes and in this way contributes to the maintena nce of cell and \\norgan integrity. Furthermore, zinc has an essential role in polynucleotide transcription and thu s, in the process of genetic \\nexpression. Zinc also plays a central role in the immune system, affecting a number of aspects of ce llular and humoral \\nimmunity. \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and excretion: \\nLike iron, zinc also needs to be liberated from food prior to a bsorption. During digestive process; proteases, nucleases and \\nhydrochloric acid all appear to release zinc bound to proteins and nucleic acids. Zinc is absorbed t hroughout the small \\nintestine, with absorption being most efficient in the jejunum. Zinc given as aqueous solution to fasting subjects is absorbed \\nto the extent of 60 -70%. However, absorption from solid diets is less efficient and varies widely depending upon the \\ncontent of the zinc in the meal and the composition of the diet. Phytates are present in whole-grain cereals and legumes \\nand in smaller amounts in other vegetables. They have a strong potential for binding divalent cation s and their depressive \\neffect on zinc absorption has been demonstrated in humans. After absorption, zinc is bound to albu min and transported to \\nthe liver. In liver, it is concentrated and then transported to different tissues by various plasma proteins. Zinc is taken up by \\nvarious tissues and is incorporated in different enzymes. Zinc is found in most organs, concentratio n being higher in liver, \\nkidney, muscle, skin and bone. Zinc content of muscle, brain, lungs and heart is relatively stable a nd does not respond to \\nchanges in dietary zinc intake. Similarly, release of zinc from bones is very slow and does not contribute zinc to other tissues \\nduring deprivation. Zinc is excreted primarily through the following three routes: \\ni) Gastrointestinal tract: Majority of zinc is lost from the body in feces. \\nii) Kidney: Very small amount of zinc is excreted in the urine (0.3-0.7 mg/day), as most of the zinc filtered by \\nthe kidney is reabsorbed. Starvation and muscle catabolism increase zinc losses in urine. \\niii) Body surface: Loss of zinc occurs due to the exfoliation of skin and sweating (0.7 -1.0 mg/day). Another \\nroute of zinc loss is hair, whic h contains 0.1 -0.2 mg Zdg hair. Strenuous exercise and elevated ambient \\ntemperatures can lead to high losses through perspiration. \\n\\uf0b7 Nutritional requirement and RDA for Zinc: \\nThe requirement for adult males is 11 mg/day and adult females are 8 mg/day. It is increased to 11 mg during pregnancy \\nand 12 mg during lactation. A tolerable upper limit of 40 mg/day for adults has been advised by the US Food and Nutrition \\nBoard. Intakes in excess of 40 mg are undesirable. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects \\nDeficiency: \\nThe clinical features of severe zinc deficiency in humans are growth retardation, delayed sexual and bone maturation, sk in \\nlesions, diarrhea, alopecia (loss of hair or baldness), impaired appetite, increased susceptibility to infections mediated vi a \\ndefects in the immune syst em, and the appearance of behavioral changes. The central role of zinc in cell division, protein \\nsynthesis and growth is especially important for infants, children, adolescents and pregnant women; these groups suffer \\nmost from an inadequate zinc intake. Zi nc-responsive stunting has also been identified in several studies. Even though zinc \\nis an essential requirement for a healthy body, too much zinc can be harmful. \\nToxicity:  \\nGross acute zinc toxicity has been reported after consuming water stored in galvanized containers. S ymptoms include \\nnausea, vomiting and fever. These symptoms are observed after ingestion of 2g or more of zinc. Long -term zinc intakes'),\n",

Copper seems to be \\nespecially sensitive to high zinc doses. Intakes between 25 -50 mg zinc per day have been reported to interfere with \\nmetabolism of both iron and copper. FAO/NHO 200 4 therefore recommended the upper level of zinc intake for an adult \\nman at 45 mg/day.  \\n3.3.5.3 COPPER \\nFrom very early times, copper compounds were used to treat various diseases. It is now known that copper is a constituent \\nof several enzymes and proteins,  most of which catalyze oxidation reduction reactions. In the body, copper occurs in two \\noxidation states- Cu\" (Cuprous) or Cu2+ (Cupric). The body of a healthy adult contains a little over 0.1 g of copper w ith \\nconcentration being high in liver, brain, hea rt, bone, hair and nails. About 25 % of body copper is present in muscle, and \\n42% in the skeleton. \\n\\uf0b7 Food sources of Copper: \\nGreen leafy vegetables, nuts, legumes, dried fruits, muscle meats and shellfish especially oysters are foods containing more \\nthan 1 m g copper per 1000 kilocalories. Copper though present in small amounts in the food needs to be absor bed, \\ntransported, stored and excreted efficiently so as to be able to perform its host of functions some of which are critical for  \\nother metabolic functions in our body. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions of copper: \\nCopper serves as a co -factor, as well as, an allosteric component of enzymes. In many enzymes copper functions as an \\nintermediate in electron transfer. Copper appears to influence gene expression through binding to specific transcription \\nfactors. In some cases, copper has been shown to influence transcription by binding to transcription  factor, which in turn \\nbinds to promoter sequence of DNA. \\nAbsorption, storage and excretion: \\nIn food, most copper is present as Cu2+ and some as Cu+. This copper is bound to organic compounds especially protein. \\npepsin and some proteolytic enzymes aid in the release of copper. Released copper forms soluble comp lexes with amino \\nacids, organic acids and other chelators which are readily absorbed mainly in the upper intestinal tract. Some copper is also \\nabsorbed from the stomach; Once copper is within the intestinal cell, it may be used by the cell, may be stored in the cell or \\nmay be transported across the basolateral membrane. Most absorb ed copper is secreted by the liver into the bile to be \\nexcreted jn the feces. This process is the major regulator of copper elimination. Only small amount of copper (10-50 mcg) is \\nexcreted through kidney. Thus, the absorption and excretion process of coppe r helps in maintaining optimum levels of this \\nelement in our body so that it can help in performing a number of metabolic reactions in the body.  \\n\\uf0b7 Nutritional requirements: \\nSafe and adequate range for copper intake is 1.5-3 mg/day. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects: \\nDeficiency: \\nThe predisposing factors of copper deficiency are prematurity, low birth weight and malnutrition, especially when \\ncombined with feeding practices such as cow\\'s milk or total parenteral nutrition. The most frequent symptoms are anemia, \\nneutropenia (abnormally high levels of a type of WBC\\'s in blood) and bone fractures. Other less frequent symptoms include \\nhypo-pigmentation, impaired growth, and an increased incidence of infections and abnormalities of glucose and cholesterol \\nmetabolism. \\nToxicity \\nAcute copper toxicity in humans is rare and occurs due to inadvertent consumption of copper salts.

Total selenium content of the body varies from 3 -15 mg depending on the dietary \\nintake. Approximately 30% of tissue selenium is contained in the liver, \\n15% in kidney, 30% in muscle and 10% in blood plasma. \\n\\uf0b7 Food Sources of selenium: \\nEnvironmental conditions and agricultural practices have a profound influence on the selenium content of many foods. \\nSelenium enters the food chain through plants. The concentration of selenium in plants is directly r elated to the \\nconcentration of the mineral in the soil on wh ich plants were grown. Among the different trace elements, selenium varies \\ngreatly in its soil concentration. The absorption of selenium by plants is not only dependent on the  concentration of \\nselenium in the soil but also on pH, microbial activity, rainfall and the chemical form of selenium. Owing to all above factors, \\nthe selenium content in food varies greatly. Overall, animal products, especially organ meats, are t hought to contain more \\nselenium than plant sources \\nUntil recently, the only known metaboli c role of selenium in humans was as a component of glutathione peroxidase which \\nalong with vitamin E and superoxide dismutase forms a part of the antioxidant defense system. Seleno proteins in animals \\nand humans are involved in protection from oxidative dam age, maintaining adequate thyroid hormone status and \\nprotection from injury by a heavy metal like mercury. \\nSelenium compounds' are generally very efficiently absorbed by humans and selenium absorption does n ot appear to be' \\nunder homeostatic control. Selen ium is mainly absorbed from the duodenum. Less absorption occurs in the jejunum and \\nileum. In addition, some dietary factors appear to influence the absorption of the element. Phytates and heavy metals, such \\nas mercury through chelation and precipitation, hinder selenium absorption. Vitamins C, A and E, as well as, glutathione \\nenhance the absorption. Selenium is excreted from the body almost equally in the urine (as methyl se lenium) and feces \\n(unabsorbed selenium, biliary, pancreatic and intestinal secretio n). Unlike copper, selenium is rapidly excreted in urine. \\nSelenium losses through lungs and skin also contribute to daily selenium excretion. \\n\\uf0b7 Nutritional requirements: \\nIn the U.S., recommended nutrient intake is 70 mcg/day for men and 55 mcg/day for women. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects: \\nDeficiency \\nSelenium deficiency has been linked to two regional human diseases: Keshan disease and Kashin Beck's disease.  \\nKeshan disease: It is a cardiomyopathy (disease of the myocardium, involving heart  muscle) that was identified to affect \\nchildren and women of child bearing age in China. \\nKashin Beck disease: Kashin Beck disease was identified to affect growing children in parts of Siberian Russia and China.  It \\nis characterized by osteoarthritis involving degeneration and necrosis of the joints and epiphyseal -plate cartilages of legs \\nand arms. \\nToxicity \\nThere is a narrow margin between the beneficial and harmful intakes of selenium. The level at which selenosis occurs is not \\nwell-defined but threshold for toxicity appears to be 850 -900 microgram per day. Symptoms of chronic toxicity include \\nbrittle hair and nails, skin lesions with secondary infections and garlic odor in the breath.\"),\n",

Chromium supplementation is kn own to improve \\nimpaired glucose tolerance. Like other elements, Chromium also exists in several oxidation states fr om Cr2 - to Cr 6+ \\nhowever Cr3+ or the trivalent form is the biologically important one. \\n\\uf0b7 Food Sources \\nLike we know, chromium occurs in trivalent form in foods. Good sources of chromium include whole gra ins, spices and \\ncondiments, meats especially organ meats, mushrooms, cheese, prunes and tea. Brewer's yeast has a hi gh content of \\nbiologically active organi cally complexed form known as the Glucose Tolerance Factor (GTF). Chromium forms complexes \\nwith nicotinic acid and amino acids to form GTF. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions \\nActive chromium as GTF potentiates the action of insulin and thus influences carbohydrate, lipid and insulin metabolism. \\n1. Role in Insulin Formation:  chromium activates the 'insulin receptor tyrosine kinase' and inhibits the 'insulin receptor \\ntyrosine phosphatase which leads to an increased phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, which is a ssociated with \\nincreased insulin sensitivity. Since chromium improves insulin function, it is suggested that chromium may play a role in \\nglucose and lipid metabolism. \\n2. Role in Glucose, Lipid and Nucleic Acid Metabolism: Chromium leads to a decrease in blood glucose concentration in \\npeople with elevated glucose levels and an increase in those with low blood glucose levels. It shows no effect in the \\nsubjects with normal blood glucose levels. \\nOverall, chromium appears to reduce levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides in blood and increase \\nlevel of HDL cholesterol. \\nAnother proposed role for chromium is in relation to nucleic acid metabolism. It is postulated that Cr3+ is involved in \\nmaintaining the structural integrity of nuclear strands and in the regulation of gene expression. \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and excretion: \\nChromium appears to be absorbed throughout the small intestine, with absorption being higher in jeju num. The \\nmechanism of absorption involves simple diffusion and other processes. As compared to healthy indivi duals, insulin -\\ndependent diabetic patients absorb 2 -4 times more chromium. It appears that these patients have an impaired ability to \\nconvert inorganic form to usable form and therefore require higher chromium. \\nAfter absorption, chromium binds to plasma proteins for transportation. Both tr ansferring and albumin are capable of \\nbinding absorbed Cr. Although transferrin and albumin play the major roles in transportation, other plasma proteins such as \\nalpha and beta globulins and lipoproteins are also involved. It appears that absorbed inorgani c chromium is transported to \\nthe liver, which is postulated to be the possible site for synthesis of metabolically active molecule. This molecule is held in a \\nbody pool and released as needed. \\nMost ingested chromium is excreted in feces. Inorganic chromium  is excreted primarily by the kidney, with small amounts \\nbeing excreted through hair, sweat and bile. Organically bound chromium is excreted through bile. \\n\\uf0b7 Nutritional requirements: \\nThere is no Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for chromium but adequate i ntakes that can be used as a goal for \\nindividual intakes has been proposed by the Food Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Services , USA. An adult male \\nand female require up to 30 and 20 microgram per day. During pregnancy and lactation chromium needs increase to 30 and \\n45 micrograms per day respectively.\"),\n",

Individuals receiving TPN without chromium have been \\nshown to develop symptoms of deficiency such as imp aired glucose tolerance with high blood glucose level and glucose \\nexcretion in urine. Peripheral neuropathy has also been reported which was reversed with chromium su pplementation. \\nChromium deficiency results in insulin resistance characterized by hyperinsulinemia. Hyperinsulinemia is implicated as a risk \\nfactor for coronary heart disease. \\nToxicity \\n\\' Trivalent chromium, the form of chromium found in foods and supplements, is least toxic. Oral supple ments up to 800 to \\n1000 mcg per day appear to be safe. Cr6+  on the other hand can be highly toxic. Inhalation of Cf\" may result in respiratory \\ndisease while direct contact results in dermatitis and skin ulceration and sometimes liver damage. \\n3.3.5.6 MANGANESE \\nIn living tissues, manganese is found in the + 2, +3 and +4 oxidation states. An adult man is estimated to contain 10 -20 mg \\nof the metal, with 25% of the total body stores in the skeleton. In addition, the rest is present in liver, pancreas and \\nintestine. \\n\\uf0b7 Food Sources \\nThe food sources of manganese are whole cereals, nuts; leafy vegetables and tea. Diets high in foods of plant origin provide \\nan average 8.3 mg of manganese per day. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions \\nLike other microminerals, Mn also functions in mammalian enzyme systems. It can function both as an integral part of \\nmetalloenzymes and as an enzyme activator. \\n1. Antioxidant activity: As Mn is a component of mitochondria (Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), it can protect against \\noxidative damage. \\n2. Carbohydrate metabolism: Mn is required for carbohydrate metabolism. \\n3. Integrity of cartilag e: Mn plays an important role in proteoglycan biosynthesis, which is essential for the integrity of \\ncartilage. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and excretion: \\nIntestinal absorption of Mn occurs throughout the length of the small intestine. Ingested manganese is thought to be \\nconverted into Mn3+ in the duodenum. Studies show that the mucosal uptake could be a rapidly saturab le process, which \\nappears to be mediated by a high-affinity, low-capacity active transport system. Absorption of Mn from the diet is very low. \\nOn the basis of Mn retention, it has been estimated that adult humans absorb 4.8% of ingested manganese. \\nAfter absorption, Mn is complexed with albumin and transported to the liver, which is the key organ in its metabolism. Mn \\nis found in most organs and tissues and preferentially accumulates in the mitochondria. There is no storage form for Mn. \\nBone contains substantial amount of mineral but there is no mechanism to release it and thus bone Mn  is considered as \\npassive storage. \\nMn is almost totally excreted in the feces (92%). Excess absorbed MI is quickly excreted by the liver into the bile to maintain \\nhomeostasis. Only trace amounts are excreted in urine.'),\n",

An adult male and female require up to 2.3 and 1.8 mg per day. During preg nancy and lactation \\nmanganese needs increase to 2.0 and 2.6 mg per day respectively. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects: \\nDeficiency \\nHumans, there is a little evidence of Mn deficiency as this mineral is widely distributed in a varie ty of foods. However, \\nlimited studies have reported symptoms of its deficiency after consuming experimental diets deficien t in Mn. These \\nincluded d ermatitis, depressed growth of hair and nail, hypocholesterolemia and weight loss. Mn deprivation ha s been \\nassociated with osteoporosis, diabetes, epilepsy, and atherosclerosis and impaired wound healing. \\nToxicity \\nManganese is considered least toxic of the  trace minerals through oral intake. Majority of Mn toxicity cases have been \\nreported from individuals exposed to airborne Mn in industrial areas in excess of 5 mg per cubic meter. Mn toxicity is a \\nserious health hazard; in its severe form it results in se rious psychiatric symptoms such as hyperirritability, violent acts, \\nhallucinations and poor coordination. Several abnormalities occur in the central nervous system, the  morphological lesions \\nbeing similar to Parkinson's disease. \\n3.3.5.7 IODINE \\nIodine is of  nutritional importance as a constituent of thyroid hormones which are indispensable for normal growt h and \\ndevelopment in humans. Synthesis of the iodine containing thyroid hormones occurs exclusively in the  thyroid gland. The \\nrelation between iodine defic iency and enlargement of the thyroid gland or goiter was found when it was seen that the \\nthyroid gland became hyperplastic or there was an increase in number of normal cells in an organ and therefore an increase \\nin volume or size of the organ with low leve l of iodine in the body.  Iodine is a non -metallic element of the halogen group \\nand it is typically found and functions in its ionic form, iodide (I-'). About 15 -20 mg iodine is found in human body, of which \\n70 -80% is present in the thyroid gland. The thy roid gland weighs 15-25 grams and has a remarkable ability to concentrate \\niodine. In the iodine deficient individual, enlarged thyroid gland may contain only 1 mg iodine. \\n\\uf0b7 Food Sources \\nThe iodine concentration in foods is highly variable and also depends on  the concentration of iodine content of soil in that \\nregion. The amount of iodide in drinking water is an indicator of the iodide content of the rocks an d soils of a region and i t \\nparallels the incidence of iodine deficiency among the inhabitants of that r egion. The iodine present in the upper crust of \\nthe earth is leached by glaciation and repeated flooding, and is carried to the sea. Seawater is, th erefore, a rich source of  \\niodine. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions of Iodine: \\nIodine is an essential constituent of the thyroid hormones: thyroxin (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which have a key role in \\ngrowth and development. \\nThyroid hormone performs multiple functions as regulator of cell activity and growth. The hormone ha s crucial metabolic \\nroles in the fetus and in the infant (p ost-natal).It promotes growth and maturation of peripheral tissues in the human \\nembryo, the most visible effect seen in the skeletal growth. Delayed bone development has been seen in hormone deficient \\nhuman embryos. Thyroid hormone influences neuronal cell  growth and dendrite development in the embryo. A major \\neffect of fetal iodine deficiency is cretinism, characterized by mental deficiency and deaf mutism (defects of hearing and \\nspeech), squint, disorders of stance and gait and stunted growth. Linear grow th, i.e. stature and bone maturation are \\ncritically dependent on thyroid hormone. Both are retarded when there is a deficiency of the hormone  due to low iodide \\nintakes. The hormone plays an important role in the provision of energy to most cells in the bod y; the best indicator of this \\nis the energy available for utilization in the basal state, i.e. the basal metabolic rate. In endemi c iodine deficient region s \\nschool children have been shown to have general IQs 10 points lower than children in non -iodine deficient areas. Reduced\"),\n",

They are necessary for the normal nervous system development and linear growth. Directly or \\nindirectly, most organs are under the influence of these substances. \\nIt is probable that iodine has additional roles to that of thyroid hormones activity, e.g.in antibio tic and anticancer activity, \\nbut these have not yet been researched well. \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and excretion: \\nLike other nutrients, dietary iodide is either found free or bound to amino acids. It is primarily found as iodide or iodate. The \\nlatter form is reduced to  iodide by glutathione in the gut. Iodide is rapidly 'and completely absorbed throughout the \\ngastrointestinal tract and very little iodine appears in feces. After absorption, free iodide appears in the blood and circulates \\nto all tissues. Thyroid gland traps most of the ingested iodide (80%). \\nUnutilized iodide is excreted via kidneys, which forms the major route of iodide excretion (80 -90 %). The urinary output of \\niodide correlates closely with the plasma iodide concentration and has been used to monitor io dide status. Some iodide is \\nalso lost in sweat, especially in the hot tropical regions. \\n\\uf0b7 Nutritional requirements of Iodine: \\nThe minimum amount of iodide to prevent goitre is estimated between 50 and 75 mcg/day or 1 mcg/kg bo dy weight. The \\n1989 ICMR recommended RDA is 150 mcg/day for adults of both sexes. Although the recommendations are the same for \\nboth males and females, iodide needs are higher during pregnancy and lactation and recommended intak es are 175 -200 \\nmcg iodine per day. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects: \\nDeficiency \\nIodine deficiency affects all populations at all stages of life, from the intrauterine stage to old age. However, pregnant \\nwomen, lactating women, women of reproductive age, and children younger than 3 years of age are cons idered the most \\nimportant group s because iodine deficiency occurring during fetal and neonatal growth and development leads to \\nirreversible damage of the brain and central nervous system and, consequently, to irreversible menta l retardation. Mild \\ngoitre, endemic cretinism, hypothyroidis m are c ollective manifestations of iodine deficiency and are termed as 'Iodine \\nDeficiency Disorders' (IDD). \\nApart from cretinism, hypothyroidism and goitre, other features linked to IDD are the decreased fert ility rates, increased \\nstillbirths and spontaneo us abortion rates and increased perinatal and infant mortality. Epidemiological studies have \\nindicated that an ingestion of 100 -200 mg of iodine daily is sufficient to prevent deficiency except among individuals \\nsuffering from a genetic disorder. \\nToxicity \\nOver 2 mg iodine per day for long periods is regarded as excessive or potentially harmful  that are very high in seafood \\nand/or seaweed or comprising foods contaminated with iodine. Iodine -induced thyrotoxicosis (hyperthyroidism) and toxic \\nmodular goiter may result from excess iodine exposure. Hyperthyroidism is largely confined to those over 40 years of age  \\nand symptoms are rapid heart rate, trembling, excessive sweating, lack of sleep, and loss of weight and strength. Individuals \\nwho are sensitive to iodine usually have mild skin symptoms.\"),\n",

Fluorine (F) is a gaseous chemical element, while its ion, fluoride (F) is composed of fluorine bound to \\na metal, non -metal, or an organic compound. Fluoride predominates in nature and in body, it is deposited in bones  and \\nteeth. Its incorporation into tooth enamel markedly increases the hardness and resistance to decay. \\n\\uf0b7 Food Sources \\nThe major source of fluoride in most diets is water, with foods providing only about 25% of total in take. These include tea \\nand marine fish, ready-to-use infant formulas made with fluoridated water. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions of Fluorine: \\nThe only beneficial role demonstrated for fluoride is in reducing the prevalence and severity of dental caries in children and \\nadults. There are three ways in which fluoride may act to prevent tooth decay.  \\nWhen fluoride is incorporated into the tooth early in life at the time of tooth eruption, the enamel  containing fluoroapatite \\nbecomes more resistant to dissolution by acids. Secondly, as the enamel gets demineralized by contact with food acids and \\npresence of fluorine ensures that enamel structure is maintained. Lastly, fluoride inhibits glycolys is and reduces acid \\nformation from sugars on the teeth helping to prevent enamel demineralization and tooth decay. \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and excretion: \\nSoluble fluorides, even at high intake levels are almost completely absorbed from gastrointestinal t ract. These include \\naqueous solutions of fluorides, sodium fluoride used in toothpastes, and sodiu m fluorosilicate used in water fluoridation. \\nOnce absorbed, the fluoride passes into the blood for distribution chiefly to the calcified tissues.  Most of the ionic fluori de \\nenters the bone and developing teeth. About half of the fluoride absorbed each day is deposited in the skeleton or teeth \\nwithin 24 hours. Nearly 99% of the fluoride in the body is in the calcified tissues. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects: \\nDeficiency: \\nFor the above reasons, fluoride is considered as a beneficial element for humans, but it is not an e ssential element so a \\ndeficiency does not have much effect. Drinking water fluoride levels of 0.7 to1.2 mg/L is considered safe. \\nToxicity \\nFluoride is a cumulative toxin. Ingestion of fluoride 1.0 -1.5 mg/L for several years may produce dental fluorosis, i.e. \\nbrowning and pitting of teeth known as mottling, Chronic high level of fluoride in the range of 2 -5 mgL can cause skeletal \\nfluorosis. The severe forms of skeletal deformity in toxic fluorosis include kyphosis (abnormal curvature of th e spine), fixed \\nspine and other joint deformities. Hyper parathyroidism secondary to high fluoride intake has been reported, which induces \\ncalcification of soft tissues. A form of severe skeletal flourosis known as \"Genuvalgium\" (knocked k nees) has been reported \\nfrom part of India, China and African countries. The condition is characterized by severe skeletal fluorosis and osteo porosis \\nof the limbs. \\n3.4 Other constituents of Food \\nApart from major nutrients like carbohydrates, proteins, fats and minor nutrients like vitamins and minerals, there are \\nsome more constituents of food which help in the digestion, absorption, assimilation of food and nutrients and excretion of \\nwastes from the body. They are water and dietary fibre.'),\n",

The need of the body for water is second only to to i ts need for air. One can \\nsurvive for weeks without food but only a few days without water. Water comes from solid foods as well as from drinks and \\nis lost by evaporation in the breath, sweat and urine. The balance of water retained in the body is carefully regulated by the \\nkidneys but excessive is lost during vomiting, diarrhea, strenuous activity or hot climate. In such conditions, water must be \\nimmediately replenished or dehydration may result. In temperate climates, at least 1 liter of water or fluid should be drunk \\nand more if heavy work is done. \\nYou may already know that the total body  water (TBW) constitutes 50-60% of the body weight. The body of a  70 kg adult \\nmale contains 42-liter water - 60% of his body weight while the body of an adult female contains 55% water. This difference \\nin both sexes is due to a higher fat content found in females. Similarly muscular people have a higher proportion of water \\nthan the less muscular or obese people. This is because the striated muscle contains more water than any other body tissue \\n(except blood). As we, age we notice that there is a steady fall  in the proportion of water which is due to an increased \\ndeposition of fat in the body, as well as, loss of muscle mass with age. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions of Water \\n1. Water as a medium and solvent: Water is the medium of all cell fluids, including digestive juices, lymph, blood, urine, \\nand perspiration. All the physiochemical reactions that occur in the cells of the body take place in  the precisely \\nregulated environment of the body fluids. Water enters into many essential reactions, such as hydrolysis, that occurs in \\ndigestion. Water is an end product in the oxidation of energy-yielding nutrients. \\n2. Water as a lubricant: All fluids have lubricating as they can make it easier for the solid materials to slip over one \\nanother. Water-based fluids act as lubricants in various parts  of the body, most notably within joints where synovial \\nfluid makes movements easier and minimizes wear and tear in cartilage and bone. \\n3. Water as a temperature regulator: Water plays an important role in the distribution of heat throughout the body and \\nthe regulation of body temperature. Heat is generated in the body due to hard work, exposure to heat, fever or merely \\nby the metabolism of energy -yielding nutrients. The most effective route of heat loss from the body is via the \\nevaporation of water as perspiration from the surface of the skin. \\n4. Water as a source of dietary minerals: Though water is composed of only oxygen and hydrogen, the water we drink or \\nuse in food preparation can contain significant amounts of minerals, such as calcium, magnesium, zin c, co pper and \\nfluoride; the amount will vary based on the source of water and any treatment the water has been put  through. While \\nhard water will contain magnesium and calcium, the soft water may contain sodium. \\n \\nWater distribution in the body: \\nWithin the body, water is found in two major compartments. These are: . \\n\\uf0b7 The intracellular compartment (inside the cell) \\n\\uf0b7 The extracellular compartment (outside the cell). \\nThe intracellular puid or the water within the cells makes up about 40-45% of the total body weight. Because the body cells \\nare the sites of vast metabolic  activity, it is of no surprise that the total water inside the body cells is about  twice the \\namount outside the cells. These are high in potassium and magnesium and low in sodium and chloride ions. \\nThe extracellular fluid compartment is further subdivided into several smaller compartments as you may have noticed in \\nFigure 6.2. These include: \\n\\uf0b7 Plasma \\n\\uf0b7 The intravascular fluid compartment, and \\n\\uf0b7 The intercellular [interstitial or extra vascular fluid (ISF)] compartment. \\n\\uf0b7 The transcellular fluid compartment \\nThe movement of water is controlled mainly by osmotic pressure generated by the inorganic ions in so lution in the body.  \\nOsmotic pressure refers to the pressure exerted by water or solvents flowing into a soluti on at the cell membrane. The \\nosmotic pressure  of the intracellular fluid is the function of its content of potassium, the predominant  cation in the'),\n",

By contrast, the osmotic  pressure of extracellular fluid may be considered relative to its content of \\nsodium, the major cation present in extracellular fluid. Variations in the distribution of  sodium and potassium ions are the \\nprincipal causes of water shifts between the various compartments, \\nWATER BALANCE \\nThe amount of fluid in the body is tightly controlled because imbalance can be \\ndevastating. In a normal individual, the maintenance of water balance is achieved by adjusting both water intake and \\nexcretion as needed. \\nWater Intake \\nThe, major sources of water are: \\n1. The preformed water that we consume as water or as beverage. This will include both preformed water in fluids \\nand in food.  Foods (other than water and beverages) are the second most important sources of water for the \\nbody. Most foods contain 50% water, but milk has the highest amount of water. Fruits and vegetables rank next to \\nmilk, while fats and oils do not contain any water, The water contained in cookies, cakes and chocol ates are \\nrelatively low. This entire group contributes to 25 -30% of daily water intake. This may also be refer red to as \\npreformed water in foods. \\n2. Water that arises from oxidation of foods within the body, which is referred to as water of oxidation or metabolic \\nwater. Water which comes from the oxidation of food is the last source of water. 1 g of starch yields 0.6  g of \\nwater; 1 g of protein 0.41g; and 1 g of fat gives 1.07 g of water. This source contributes only about 10% of the total \\nwater input. This is also known as water of oxidation or metabolic waste. \\nWater Output (Losses of body water) \\nWater is lost from the body by the four routes, namely kidneys (renal system), skin, lungs and intestine. \\n1. Renal loss: Normal adult kidneys excrete about 1-2 liters of urine daily. The \\nwater in this total volume is made up of two portions: obligatory and facultative. \\n2. Skin: The water loss from the skin is through perspiration, which could be \\ninsensible and /or visible. \\n3. Intestine: A small quantity of water (about 100 -200 ml) is normally lost in feces, but this can exceed 5 L in \\ndiarrhoea1 episodes. \\n4. Lungs: The air expired from th e lungs also contains water. Any condition that would increase the rate of \\nrespiration. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Nutritional requirements for water \\nThe body has no provision for water storage; therefore, the amount of water lost every 24 hours must  be replaced to \\nmaintain health and body efficiency. The precise need for water depends on a person's body weight and lifestyle. a \\nreasonable allowance based on recommended energy intake is 1.0 ml / Kcal for adults and 1.5 ml / Iccal for infants.

Exercise, high temperature, low \\nhumidity, high altitude and a high fibre diet increase fluid needs. Alcoholic beverages and those co ntaining caffeine such as \\ncoffee, tea and sodas, however, are not good substitutes for water; both alcohol and caff eine act as diuretics, causing the \\nbody to lose fluids. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects \\nThe correct functioning of cells and tissues depends on appropriate concentrations of nutrients; so any abnormal loss or \\naccumulation of fluid can cause a variety of problems.  \\nDehydration: \\nDehydration is defined as the excessive loss of body water. It may occur because of inadequate intake, or abnormal loss of \\nbody water or a combination of both. The symptoms of dehydration are : \\n\\uf0b7 Thirst \\n\\uf0b7 Loss of appetite \\n\\uf0b7 Decreased urination \\n\\uf0b7 Impaired physical performance \\n\\uf0b7 Nausea \\n\\uf0b7 Impaired temperature regulation \\n\\uf0b7 Muscle spasms \\n\\uf0b7 Increased pulse rate \\n\\uf0b7 Increased respiration rate \\n\\uf0b7 General debilitation \\nWith water loss in excess of 10% of body weight, there is a possibility of cardiovascular failure ca used by a  reduction in \\nblood pressure and a compensating increase in the heart rate. People for whom water losses may be ac companied by \\nsignificant losses of sodium include those engaged in strenuous physical activity of any sort, those  exposed to high \\nenvironmental temperatures at work, and visitors to tropical regions who are unaccustomed to heat. Such people, and in \\ngeneral anyone loosing in excess may need small amounts of salt along with the fluid they drink to i ntake up their sodium \\nloss. One other situation that demands extra fluid for the body is a long airplane flighl; a traveler can lose approximalely 1.5 \\nlitres of water during a 3-hour flight chiefly due to increased in sensible perspiration. The dehumidified air in the airplane is \\nso dry that excessive \\'i nsensible\\' perspiration and evaporation occur. Athletes in good physical condition experience a \\nreduction in athletic performance if they lose 3% of body water. Reduction of as little as 2% of tot al body water causes a \\ndecline of 20 to 30% in efficiency at  work. Fluid loss secondary to diarrhea has been responsible for thousands of deaths of \\nchildren in developing countries. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT).with a simple mixture of water, sal ts and sugar has been \\nhighly effective in reducing the number of deaths. \\nOedema \\nIn some pathological conditions, the body is in a positive water balance; that is the intake of flui ds is greater than the \\nexcretion, and the patient is said to have edema.  Oedema results when the body water is increased to the levels of 10% or  \\nmore above normal. Kwashiorkor, a dietary protein deficiency in PEM, Nephrotic syndrome, Congestive cardiac failure (CCF) \\nand cirrhosis of the liver are conditions when oedema is seen. Low or loss of plasma proteins, distu rbance in sodium \\nexcretion are causes of water retention or oedema  in the body. \\n3.4.2 DIETARY FIBRE: \\nSome foods particularly cereals and some fruits and vegetables, contain substantial amounts of dietary fibre or roughage. In \\ncontrast to other nutrients, this mixture of indigestible mate rials is not absorbed into the body; instead it adds bulk to the \\nfeces. This property is beneficial to health. In other words \"Dietary fibre is the edible part of plants or analogous \\ncarbohydrates that are resistant to digestion and absorption in the human  small intestine with complete or partial \\nfermentation in the large intestine. Dietary fibre includes polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, ligni n and associated plant \\nsubstances. Metabolic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, as well as, the d iseases which were a result of \\nstraining at stool such as diverticular disease, hiatus hernia and hemorrhoids are a result of low fiber in the diet.'),\n",

It is  \\nnot fibrous and is completely digested and has little effect on feces (unlike dietary fibre), yet it is often considered as a part \\nof dietary fibre. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions: \\nDietary fibre has major effects on: \\na) Satiety: Ingestion of a high fibre food induces a feeling of satiety, reduces meal size and food intake. \\nb) Nutrient Absorption: Inclusion of fibre has been shown to retard the absorption of some nutrients. The inclusion of \\nviscous polysaccharides reduces the postprandial glucose level concentration. \\nc) Integrity of gut/colon: Dietary fibre especially fermentable fibres, play an important role in maintaining the integrity of \\ngut. \\nd) Stool weight and laxation: The amount of stool excreted varies markedly from individual to individual and in an \\nindividual over a period of time. \\n\\uf0b7 Recommended Intake of Fibre: \\nAn intake of 10 -13 g dietary fibre intake per 1000 Kcal also has been suggested by American dietary association and an \\nupper limit of 35 g/day. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects: \\nDietary fibre plays a protective role against chronic degenerative diseases  like colon cancer and cardiovascular diseases. \\nFurther, fiber has been shown to lower serum estrogen concentrations, and therefore may have a prote ctive effect against \\nhormone-related cancers. Recent studies have shown a decreased risk of endometrial canc er, ovarian cancer, and prostate \\ncancer with high fiber intakes. \\nThus, dietary fibre is now .recognized as important component of diet and plays an important role in  gastrointestinal \\nphysiology and has a number of potential health benefits. \\n 3.5  Let us sum up: \\n\\uf0b7 We learnt that vitamins and minerals are vital to the body functions even if they are needed in very  small amounts. \\nVitamins are categorized into fat soluble and water soluble vitamins.

However, Na and K majorly function by changing their location i.e., from one side of plasma membr ane \\nto other. Regulation occurs either at the level of absorption or excretion or storage. In addition, these minerals interact with \\neach other and other nu trients thereby influencing their bioavailability.

Therefore, \\ndiets have to be designed to provide for optimum nutri tion. Such diets are called balanced diets. A balanced diet provides \\nfor the energy necessary for the body to function and all nutrients in right proportions for bodybui lding, repair and \\nprotection against diseases.'),\n",

Hence, \\nwith lot of research, experts have found out the kinds of food and their nutritional values which we need to take in our daily \\ndiet. They have translated the calories and amount of nutrients into portions so that it is easy for us to plan a balanced \\nmeal. This is also known as the food guide wherein foods are grouped according to the nutrients they provide.  \\nThis guide helps in food selection and ensures good nutrition on a daily basis. \\nMenu planning is a creative activity and generally requires some intelligent thinking and manipulation. This is because apart \\nfrom the influence of age and sex of an individual, his/her physique, physiological condition, level  of physical  activity also \\neffects the requirements of nutrients to the body. Climatic conditions, growth and pathological stre ss play an important \\nrole in nutritional demands of the body. All these factors have to be taken into consideration while  planning a menu for an \\nindividual.  \\nUnlike balanced diet where foods are grouped for easy usage, meal planning involves the application of dietary knowledge \\nof nutrients as exchange list; interaction of nutrients with each other and other technical know how  to plan a meal fo r an \\nindividual. This is especially beneficial for people with any medical disorder or pathological stress. \\n4.2 The Indian RDI \\nThere were several reasons for setting up the RDIs. Long back in 1936 it was found that the effects of deficient diets were \\ndrastic, so countries in the League of Nations set up a committe e to recommend daily dietary  allowances for each of the \\nknown nutrients. Later during the Second World War, many recruits were rejected from the army, as th ey were \\nunderweight. The governments in v arious countries were shocked with the rate of rejection and anxious to change this \\nsituation. They formed an Expert Committees to set up Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) to guide  people to meet \\ntheir nutritional needs and their daily requirements of food. Thus, the RDAs were set up in various countries between 1940 \\nand 1944.  \\nOver the years, these recommendations had to be revised based on newer research findings. In India, major revisions were \\nmade in 1958, 1968 and 1981. The 1981 revision is entitled Recommended Dietary Intakes (RDIs) for Indians. The name has \\nbeen revised to emphasize intake. These values are not final and will be revised as and when there a re new research \\nfindings. \\nWhen RDIs were laid down for India and provision for adequate amoun ts of nutrients to the body was thought of then it \\nwas necessary to express the age and body dimension of the person. This was to ensure that all perso ns would meet their \\nnutrient needs. Therefore, one representative person was chosen whose age and body si ze was defined. Therefore, the \\nthought of a reference man and a reference woman came into being. \\nA reference man is of age 20-39 years, weighs approximately 55 kgs whereas a reference woman is of age 20-39 years, and \\nweighs 45 kgs. \\nRefer to table no.4.2 for RDIs for Indian adults \\n The Recommended dietary intakes are given for:- \\n1. Energy \\n2. Proteins \\n3. Minerals--Calcium and iron \\n4. Vitamins-Water soluble- (vitamin C and vitamin B- thiamine, riboflavin and niacin) \\n5. Vitamins-Fat soluble-(vitamins A and D) \\nOur body needs only two nutrients in large amounts –Energy in kilocalories and proteins in grams.  \\n1. Energy: RDIs for energy are with reference to average or reference weights. Although there is normally no need for \\nadjustment for groups of different weights, there is evidence that average energy intakes are now lower perhaps in \\nrelation to our reduced energy expenditure. \\n2. Protein: The RDIs for protein represent 10 per cent of the energy requirement (ex. For a pregnant woman, 60g of \\nprotein provides 240 kcal, which is 10  percent of her total requirement of 2400 kcal.)Our need for protein is about 1'),\n",

Therefore, the protein RDI for the reference man is 55 gm and the reference woman is 45 gm. \\nIt should however be noted that if energy requirements are not fully met at the same time, that protein which is eaten \\nwill be utilized more to provide the needed energy than for growth and tissue repair. \\n3. Fat and carbohydrate: There appears to be no absolute dietary requirement for either fat or carbohydrate except for \\na small amount (1 -2 per cent of energy requirement) of essential fatty acids and some carbohydrates (50 -100 g/day) \\nare necessary to prevent the undesirable effects that result from extremely high fat diets. \\n \\nHowever in contrast to the recommendations for protein, minerals and vitamins which are designed to ensure that the \\nintakes by different groups of the population are high enough for health, a number of bodies in deve loped countries have \\nsuggested dietary guidelines to restrict intakes of fat, sugar s and alcohol. This is because there is growing concern that \\nsome individuals are obtaining too much of these nutrients (and not enough dietary fibre). \\n1. Calcium and Iron: Both recommendations allow for the limited absorption of these nutrients from the diet. \\n2. Niacin and Vitamin A: The intakes recommended allow for the likely contributions made by tryptophan and carotenes \\nto the pre-formed nicotinic acid and retinol intakes respectively. \\n3. Vitamin C: There are differing opinions as to the quantity of vitamin C r equired for health. It is generally agreed that \\n10 mg daily will not only prevent but also cure scurvy. The recommended intake of 30 mg is thought t o provide a \\nreasonable safety margin; there is no nutritional advantage from enormously higher intakes altho ugh there may be \\nsome pharmacological action. \\n4. Vitamin D: It is not possible to make firm estimates of dietary needs because most of our requirements are met by \\nvitamin D formed from the action of sunlight on a substance present in the skin. The amounts rec ommended may be \\nconsidered as a safety measure for those who are little exposed to sunlight. \\nExcessive intakes of many of the minerals can be harmful, as can excessive intakes of some of the vi tamins especially \\nvitamin A and D which accumulate in the liver . Such intakes are unlikely to arise from food but may result from excess use \\nof mineral and vitamin supplements. Thus, when RDIs are expressed in daily terms, it is not necessary for the diet to contain \\nthese quantities every day. It is sufficient if the requirements are met over a period of, let us say, a week. \\nBesides these, there are other nutrients, which our body needs. No specific recommendations were mad e about any of \\nthese because when we plan a meal (a good mixed diet), not only our need for the a bove nutrients from natural foods are \\nprovided for but they will also provide enough of all other nutrients also. To ensure that the recom mended intakes cover \\ndifferences in needs of healthy persons, a liberal margin of safety is provided. \\nEnergy requirements are different from other nutrients as appetite normally controls the intake and keeps it close t o its \\nrequirements and intakes in excess of requirements are undesirable and may lead to obesity. The recommendation for each \\ngroup of people is therefore set at its estimated average requirement. \\n4.2.1  Changes in RDI with age and activity \\nIt is natural that nutrient needs vary with age. Table 2.2 gives the RDIs for two major nutrients -energy and protein, for \\nvarious stages of life. We notice that there is a  progressive increase in need for nutrients with age from birth to \\nadolescence. Babies grow very fast in the first year. That is why the recommendations for the first year are given per kilo of \\nbody weight. When children become adolescents, there is rapid growth between 10-15 years, then the growth spurt.  \\nGirls grow faster than boys do during this period. Therefore, the recommendations of energy for girl s of 10 -12 years are \\nhigher than in later years. Once they reach the adult stage, the growth, developmen t of the body is nearly complete, and \\nnutrients are needed only for maintenance and repair. Thus, the requirement of adults is lower than that of adolescents. \\nBesides age, requirements vary with the kind of physical work or activity we are engaged in . As there are innumerable \\nhuman activities with varying energy needs, the experts have broadly divided these into three groups: \\n1. Sedentary worker - a sedentary person is someone who does most of the work sitting in one place and uses only \\nhands and head. A n executive, writer, typist, clerk, teacher, or a homemaker who has household help is examples of \\nsedentary workers. \\n2. Moderate worker  - a moderately active person is someone who uses the muscles of hands and feet fast and \\ncontinuously. Postal workers, house cleaners, gardeners, factory workers, waiters in hotels, farmers and homemakers \\nwho do housework themselves are examples of moderate workers.'),\n",

Heavy worker- a very active person is involved in heavy work if he uses most of the body muscle and moves quite fast \\nfor several hours each day. R ickshaw pullers, loaders, coolies, miners, workers in heavy construction work belong to \\nthis group and it includes sportsmen who practice active sports. \\nRefer to table no.4.2.1a for changes in RDIs with age. \\nRefer to table no.4.2.1b for changes in RDIs with activity. \\n4.2.2 RDIs for pregnancy and lactation \\nBesides age and activity, there is an increase in need for nutrients in  conditions like pregnancy and lactation. We can see \\nthat in the RDIs for these categories in Table. As we are aware, more than three-fourth of the growth of the fetus occurs in \\nthe second half of pregnancy.  Therefore, the recommendations for the additional needs are given for the second half  of \\npregnancy. Allowances for pregnancy or lactation are in addition to the normal needs of a woman as discussed earlier. \\nThe RDIs are highest in the first six months of lactation, because the mother feeds the infant with her milk. By the time, the \\ninfant reaches six months of age, the mother's mi lk supply decreases. We notice that the recommendations for this stage \\nand after this are eventually reduced. \\n Refer to table no.4.2.2 for RDIs for pregnancy and lactation. \\n4.2.3 Uses of RDI \\nRecommended dietary intakes were set to meet a particular need. They have several important uses like: \\n1. They can enable the government to predict food needs of the population, \\n2. They help plan supplementary feeding programs for mothers and children. \\n3. They guide agricultural planning, \\n4. They decide policy of import and export of food, \\n5. They help large catering establishments such as hostels, hospitals to calculate foods to be ordered for \\ntheir inmates, \\n6. They help organize food supply for defense personnel etc.  \\n \\n4.3 Balanced Diet \\nThe provision of palatable and acceptable meals must be the first consideration; only within this framework can planning \\nfor good nutrition be effective. \\nA balanced meal is one that provides adequate amounts of protein and of all the minerals and vitamins as well as energy. It \\nshould also provide dietary fibre, and should be limited in its fat, sugar and salt contents- particularly if these are likely to be \\namply supplied from other sources during the day. At least one balanced mal should be eaten every day. \\nMost foods contain a wide variety of common foods. Thus, the simplest way to meet nutritional standards is to eat a varied \\ndiet containing a wide selection of different types of food. \\n4.3.1 Concept and components \\nExperience and custom have influenced food choice in such a way that traditional meals ar e generally nutritionally \\nsatisfactory as well as good to eat; nevertheless to be sure that this is maintained, now that we re ly to a greater extent on  \\nsnacks and convenience foods, certain general rules can be followed: \\n1. Each meal should contain some foods  rich in protein, such as meat, poultry, fish, cheese, eggs, milk, bread or other \\ncereal product, nuts, peas or beans. \\n2. Each main meal should contain plenty of fruit and vegetables, which are good sources of vitamins and  minerals not \\ncommonly found in other foods.\"),\n",

Foods rich in energy should be eaten only in amounts, which will satisfy appetite and maintain corre ct body weight. \\nSuch foods include butter and margarine (which also vitamins A and D), bread and other cereals (whic h also provide \\nprotein, minerals, vitamins and dietary fibre) and only then jam, cakes, biscuits and other foods rich in sugar and fat. \\nThe total daily intake of each of the major nutrients that is recommended for groups of people of di fferent ages and \\noccupations. The total amount of fat should not provide more than 35 per cent of the energy in the diet, nor saturated plus \\ntrans fatty acids more than 15 per cent of energy except for small children. By implication, the total carbohydrate in the diet \\nshould provide about 55 per cent of the dietary energy.  \\nIn practice it will be found that certain meals such as traditional Sunday lunch are likely to be ri ch in many nutrients where \\nas others including breakfasts for many  people will proof a counter balance. It is the total nutrie nt intake over at least one \\nday and preferably a week, that should be assessed and even then, it is the adequacy of the diet in the longer term that is \\nimportant for health.  \\n 4.4 Food groups \\nAll these foods, which form a part of our food pattern, are divided into five food groups in the dai ly food guide for India. As \\nwe may observe, the first column in the table indicates the food group, the second column gives the foods included in the \\ngroup, the third column specific the amount, which gives the size of the serving of each food, and the last  column indicates \\nthe minimum number of servings to be taken to meet one's nutritional needs. If sufficient amounts of food from each of the \\nfive groups ar e included in the day's diet, the nutrient needs of the body will be met. Such a diet is a balanced diet, as it \\nmeets the nutritional needs of the body. \\nLet us study each of the food groups in detail and understand how it is used in practice.  \\nRefer to table no.4.4 for the food group guide. \\n 4.4.1 The cereals-millets group-1 \\nThis group includes preparations of rice, wheat, jowar, bajra, maize, ragi and their products such as rawa (suji or semolina), \\nrice flakes (poha), sevian (vermicelli), daliya (broken  cereals) etc.. The foods from this group provide more than half the \\nday's needs of our body for energy and proteins. In addition, these foods can be a valuable source o f one of the B vitamins-\\nthiamine and the mineral iron, especially if the preparation is  made from unrefined wheat flour. Chapattis made from \\nwhole wheat flour contain six times as much thiamine as bread made from the same amount of maida (refined wheat \\nflour). Parboiled rice contains more thiamine than milled, polished rice. \\n1. Size of one serv ing Any preparation made from 25 gm of any cereal is counted as unit for serving of foods from this \\ngroup. This is equal to half a katori of cooked rice, one medium chapati, two to three puries, half of a medium bhakari, \\ntwo slices of bread, two tablespoons of rice flakes (dry, not soaked) or ready-to-eat cereals. \\n2. Suggested number of servings: A  sedentary person it is suggested to include at least six servings from this group. \\nThose who are moderately active, or are involved in heavy physical work such as l oad-lifting, will need more servings \\nfrom this group. If we If we pursue any hobbies  or sports which involve intense physical work play any games like \\nbadminton, tennis, squash etc., regularly, we will need more servings from this group. \\nTeenagers need mo re servings from this group to meet their need for growth. Expectant mothers in the later half of \\npregnancy need two servings more than their normal intake; while nursing mothers may need four additional servings. \\n 4.4.2 The dal, milk, egg, fish, meat group-2 \\nAll preparations made from dals, whole pulses, milk, eggs, fish, poultry and meat are included in this group.The foods in this \\ngroup are generally used in preparations which are served with cereals. Some preparations, such as i dli, dosa are made by \\ncombining cereals such as rice or rawa (suji) with urad dal; while curd or butter milk are served with rice; egg with toast,and \\nchicken with rice. \\nOne third or more of our protein requirement is provided by these foods. The foods in this group are  good source s of \\nprotein, which is needed for growth and repair of body tissues, e.g. muscles, blood, skin, hair, etc. In addition we meet part \\nof our requirement for minerals and vitamins through these foods. These foods supply part of our B -vitamins requirement \\nalso. Milk, eggs and liver are good sources of vitamin A. Dals, eggs and meat are good sources of iron. Milk is a very good \\nsource of calcium.\"),\n",

Therefore, the serving size of each of these varies: \\n1. Dals and whole pulses 25 gm \\n2. Milk or milk preparations 150 gm \\n3. Egg (no.) 1 \\n4. Fish, meat and poultry 25-30 gm \\nOne serving of each of these foods provide 5 to 6 grams of protein. \\nSuggested number of servings: The number varies with age and body size. For example, a child may need only 3 servings, \\nwhereas a teenager may need upto 5 servings.  \\n1. Dals include all types of dals such as chana, moong, urad, masur dal, etc. As we know dal is obtained by removing the \\nseed coat of whole pulse. The whole pulse of legumes such as whole chana, moong, rajma, peas, masur (lentils), \\nmatki (moth beans), Kulthi (horsegram), etc. are all included in this group. We  know that oil seeds  such as \\ngroundnuts and sesame belong to the l egume family and are included in this group. As mentioned earlier any \\npreparation in which 25 gm of any of these foods is used is taken as a serving unit. \\n2. Milk is used as such and in a number of preparations like tea, coffee, buttermilk, curds, basundi, e tc. When we drink \\nmilk or use curd the amount used is easy to note. However, the amount of milk used in preparations v aries. We may \\nuse 15 gm to 25 gm in tea; 30 gm in coffee, a cup of buttermilk may contain 40to 50 gm milk, while a cup of ba sundi \\nmay be ma de from two to two and half cups of milk by concentrating it. Thus, our intake of these needs is to be \\nnoted to get an estimate of total milk intake. An average teacup or 150 ml of milk or a preparation in which 150 ml of \\nmilk is used is counted as one serving. \\n3. We use egg as boiled egg, omelet, in curry, pudding or custard. One medium egg weighs 50 to 52 gm and is counted \\nas one serving. If egg is used in preparation such as pudding, we can estimate the amount we eat by observing the \\nportion we eat. \\n4. When we think of a serving of fish, poultry and meat, include the lean parts (without fat) of the variety th at is eaten. \\nEven organs such as liver, heart and kidney are classified as meat. 20 to 30 gm of fish, poultry or meat can be \\ncounted as a serving. We norma lly buy these by weight. If we note the amount of fatty tissue and bone, we can \\nestimate the amount of lean part per kilogram. When these are served as chops, it is easy to estimat e the weight of \\neach chop and the number of chops eaten to estimate the inta ke. If we make a curry, it is necessary to record total \\namount of curry made and the amount served per person to estimate the intake. Please remember that t he protein \\ncontent of lean meat is less in fatty parts of meat.  \\n 4.4.3 Vegetables and fruits group-3 \\nThe vegetables and fruits we use are divided into two broad groups 3 & 4, according to their nutritional contribution. This \\nmakes it easy to choose the vegetables and fruits which meet the nutritional needs. The third food g roup is made up of \\nprotective vegetables and fruits.  \\nA) Green and Yellow Vegetables and Fruits \\n1. Dark Green leafy vegetables: All dark green leafy vegetables, such as moth (amaranth), palak (spinach), methi \\n(fenugreek), radish leaves, colocasia (alu, arbi) leaves, etc. \\n2. Light green vegetables: Cabbage (gobi), onion tops, etc. \\n3. Yellow vegetables and fruits: Carrot, pumpkin, mango, papaya, orange, apricots etc. \\nAll these vegetables and fruits have one common component, which brings them together in one group -the yellow plant \\npigment beta carotene. This pigment is converted to vitamin A in our body. These vegetables and frui ts are a rich source of \\nthis pigment. One serving of this group provides half or more of our day's need for vitamin A. In ad dition the dark green \\nleafy vegetables contain some vitamin C, minerals and fibre. \\nSize of one serving: Half a katori or 50 gm of cut vegetable or a fruit can be counted as one serving. We need at least one \\nserving every other day (once in two days) from this group. Normally the leafy vegetables are sold as a bunch or in a bundle. \\nThe weight of the bunch varies from 200 to 300 gm. After purchase, the vegetable is sorted to remove damaged leaves and \\ntough stems, thus the edible part is reduced. The amount thus lost varies with the quality and variety of the leafy vegetable \\nselected. A good quality spinach bunch has a high edible portion, being 90-95 per cent. Thus, we can get 4 to 5 servings \\nfrom such a bunch. In other leafy vegetables it may be only 70 per cent. Thus our selection can affect the cost per serving.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'producer': 'doPDF Ver 8.9 Build 950', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '2020-03-12T17:24:48+05:30', 'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\saich\\\\OneDrive\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot\\\\Medical-chatbot\\\\data\\\\book 1.pdf', 'total_pages': 141, 'page': 92, 'page_label': '93'}, page_content=\"93 \\n \\nWe buy cabbage, carrots, pumpkin by weight. Therefore it is possible to estimate the servings, if we  know the amount \\npurchased. When we buy yellow -orange fruits, we need to estimate the edible portion after deducting the weight of  skin \\nand seeds. \\nThe edible portion varies between 70 to 75 per cent in these fruits. \\nB)   Vitamin C Rich Vegetables and Fruits \\nIn a tropical country like India, we have a variety of vitamin C rich vegetables and fruits. That is  not the case in the \\ntemperate region. For example, the richest source of vitamin C in the tropics is amla (also known as  Indian gooseberry). It \\ncontains ten times as much vitamin C as any citrus fruit. Guavas are another rich source, especially  the newer varieties. \\nApples, cabbage and drumsticks, both leaves and pods are excellent sources of vitamin C. Besides these there a re citrus \\nfruits such as oranges, mosambis, and grape fruits. In addition, papaya, mango, pineapple and tomato are also good sources \\nof vitamin C. \\nSize of one serving: We can take a 50 gm portion, which may fill half a katori, as one serving. It provides half or more of our \\nday's needs for vitamin C. There are some exceptions to this serving size. This happens when we choo se a very \\nconcentrated source. For ex ample, we need only one amla or 15 gm of guava to supply half of our vitamin C requirement \\nfor the day. As .for other fruits, a quarter of a medium orange or musumbi, two segments of grape fruit or a slice of papaya, \\npineapple or mango, or one medium tomato can be counted as one serving. Please remember, a vegetable or fruit, which is \\na good source of both beta-carotene and vitamin C, will take care of both Group 3 (a) and 3 (b) servings. Some examples of \\nthese are orange and papaya, cabbage, drumstick leaves and amaranth. \\n 4.4.4 Other vegetables and fruits group-4 \\n1. Vegetables - cucumber, capsicum, pumpkin, lady finger, brinjal   \\n2. All gourds like  ash gourd, bottle gourd, snake gourd, bitter gourd, ridge gourd, sponge gourd, etc. come under this \\ncategory. \\n3. All immature beans - french beans, cluster beans, red gram (tender), etc. and peas ,  \\n4. Fruits like melons, grapes, apples, pears, chikkus, bananas and berries. \\nThese vegetables and fruits supplement the minerals, vitamins and fibre provided by group 3 in our diet. The fibrous tissues \\npresent in these fruits and vegetables are not digested and help to move the food -through the digestive tract. Thus they \\nhelp to regulate elimination of waste products from the digestive tract. \\nSize of one serving: We can count as one serving 50 gm portion or half a katori of any vegetable or fruit from this group. It \\nis suggested that we include at least two or more servings from this group daily. Most of the vegeta bles and fruits in this \\ngroup are purchased by weight. Some of the fruits bought by weight are grapes, apples, pears, etc. Bananas and melons are \\nsold by numbers. The edible portion in some of the vegetables, such as capsicum, lady finger, brinja l, french beans, papadi, \\ncluster beans (gawar), beetroot, radish, etc., is a s high as 95 to 98 per cent; while in peas it is only 50 per cent.In bananas \\nthe edible portion varies from 65 to 75 per cent. The same is true of melons. Grapes, apples. pears, chikkus (sapota) and \\nberries are generally eaten with the skin. Thus the edible portion of these fruits is more than 95 per cent. \\n 4.4.5 Sugar, jaggery, oil and fats group-5 \\nFoods in this group add taste and make our food palatable. The morning cup of tea or sherbat we enjo y on a hot summer \\nday have sugar as an essential ingredient. The bread or toast we have at tea time tastes better with butter.The taste of dal, \\nvegetable and salad is enhanced by the seasoning with oil, which is customarily a part of the Indian  diet. So we see the \\nfoods in this group have an important role of impro ving the palatability of our meals. There are basically two major classes \\nof foods included in this group. They are: \\na) Sugar, jaggery and their preparations such as jams, jellies, syrups, squashes etc. and \\n b) Oils, ghee, butter and vanaspati.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'producer': 'doPDF Ver 8.9 Build 950', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '2020-03-12T17:24:48+05:30', 'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\saich\\\\OneDrive\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot\\\\Medical-chatbot\\\\data\\\\book 1.pdf', 'total_pages': 141, 'page': 93, 'page_label': '94'}, page_content='94 \\n \\nAll these foods are mainly a source of energy. Sugars are a readily available source of energy, while oils and  fats are a \\nconcentrated source of energy. We may recall that sugars belong to the carbohydrate family and a gra m of carbohydrate \\nprovides four kilocalories of energy.One gram of fat or oil gives nine kilocalories and that is why it is a concentrated source  \\nof energy. \\nThese will be needed so as to make the food palatable. We can arrive at a good estimate by thinking of how we use it. A cup \\nof tea may require 5-10 gm sugar depending on how sweet we make it. A glass of sherbat may need 15-20 gm sugar.  \\nSize of serving for sugar: So, on an average, 20-25 gm of sugar per day will be enough for a person. It is good to remember \\nthat there is no recommended amount for sugar, as it is not an essential component in nutritional planning. Since we know \\nthat sugar is only a sweetening agent, it is good to take it in reasonably moderate amounts.  \\nOils and fats improve the taste and acceptability of foods to which these are added as a seasoning or dressing. In addition, \\nthese are necessary in the transport and utilisation of fat soluble vitamins in the body. Vegetable oils contain essential fatty \\nacids, which are necessary for growth in the weng and to maintain the health of our skin. It is necessary to include at least \\n15 gm of vegetable oil, such as groundnut, sesame, safflower, cotton seed, maize or soyabean oil in the diet daily. That will \\nmeet the need for essential fatty acids, the remaining amount can be taken as ghee, butter or vanaspati. \\nSize of serving for oils and fats: A teaspoon or 5 gm is a good unit of serving for this group. Since we use a teaspoon to add \\nsugar to beverages and to serve oillfat, it is easy to use it as a measure in serving.The total amou nt of oils and fats in the \\ndiet will vary with our total energy needs and the energy intake from foods of the first two food groups. We may know that \\nhigh fat diets are harmful to our health. Therefore the ICMR Advisory Committee (RDI 1981) suggested that the adult intake \\nof dietary fat be 20 per cent or less of the total calorie intake. \\n4.4.6 Uses of food groups in menu planning \\nPlease note the following important points in the use of the daily food guide in planning a meal: \\n1.  Select foods from the five broad food groups. \\n2. Choose at least the minimum number of servings from each of the food groups. \\n3. Make choices within each group. The foods included in each group are given in detail earlier \\nin this unit. Please remember that foods in each group are similar, but not id entical in food \\nvalue. \\n4. Try to include at least one food from group 2 in each meal. \\n5.  Use vegetables and fruits, which are in season to ensure high quality at reasonable cost. \\nPlease remember, we can add more foods from all groups to the minimum servings suggested, to make the meals \\nsatisfying. As we may have noticed, there are a large number of foods in each group. So we can choos e foods which we like \\nfrom each group and meet our nutritional needs. In a tropical country like India, we have a large va riety of vegetables and \\nfruits available in each season. We can choose any leafy vegetable, for they are all good sources of  the pigment beta -\\ncarotene. We must include sufficient amount of food from each group. The particular food we choose a nd the way we \\nseason it, is a matter of our choice. \\nOne of the questions that may worry we is, will nutritious food be more costly that what we eat at p resent? Or can we \\nafford nutritious food? The answer is an emphatic No for the first question and Yes for the second. Cost is not related to \\nnutritive value of foods. It is dependent on a availability and season; not on its nutrient content. \\nThe foods, which have a great variation in prices, are vegetables and fruits. We know that those, wh ich are in season, cost \\nthe least. What we should know is that at the peak of the season, each vegetable and fruit has the highest nutrient content, \\nflavour and taste. There has been extensive research in this aspect and it has been proved that the nutrient content and \\nyield of any plant food , whether it is spinach, beans, oranges or mangoes, is highest at the peak of the season. When we \\nbuy seasonal foods, we buy the best in terms of quality and nutrients at a reasonable price. Another  point to note is that \\ninexpensive fruits such as amla and  guava are excellent sources of vitamin C, but apples -and grapes, which are costly, are \\npoor sources of this vitamin. \\nWe can meet the needs of different members of our family by using the food guide. For example, the t eenagers in our \\nfamily can take more servings of foods from Group 2 to meet the protein requirements for growth and more servings from \\ngroups 1 and 5 to meet the high energy requirements of body building. One must be cautious about the  affinity to a group'),\n",

Even if we like it very much, we may not be able to include \\nexact amounts of food from all food groups if we choose a lot more from a single group. \\n4.5 Meal and menu planning \\nAny individual who carries the responsibility of providiilg meals has to take decisions regarding what to serve, how nluch to \\nserve, how much to spend, where to shop, how much to buy, how to prepare food, how to serve meals, a t what hour to \\nserve meal and so on. All such decisions are a part of planning meals. Extending this concept further, one could define meal \\nplanning as a simple practical exercise which irzilolves  applying the knowledge of food, nutrient requirement and individual \\npreferences to plan adequate arzd acceptable nzeals. In other terms, meal planning  means planning for adequate \\nrzutritio~z. Remember meal planning is just not an exercise of selecting the right kind of foods to help meet the  nutrient \\nneeds. It also concerns with preparing/planning attractive and enjoyable meals for all persons. Meal s must taste good and \\nsmell good. Because food is seen before it is tasted, the eyes have a role as well, in food acceptance. Meals must 'look good' \\nto be tasted to be enjoyed. To do this, the planner does not have to be knowledgeable only, but also  imaginativ e and \\ncreative. The art of skillful blending of foods in terms of colour, texture and flavour must be know n. In this context, \\ntherefore, it is said that meal planning is an art. It is an art which develops through thought and inspiration. Meal planning, \\nin fact, is a skill which improves with practice. \\n 4.5.1 Principles and objectives \\n'Menu', as we all know, is nothing but a list of dishes planned for preparation, and forms the very core of all activities in the \\nfood service establishment. Although  it may s eem a simple exercise of providing something to eat and drink, in practice,  \\ngood menu planning requires a lot of skill. It involves planning of balanced meals that  are colourful, appetizing, palatable \\nand within the economic means of the individuals  concerned. When a food has to be bought, prepared and served in large \\nquantities to people of varying tastes and requirements, for example in hospital food service, lot of attention has to be paid \\nfor this activity. It is essential to provide appetizing,  nourishing and attractive meals to the people at a reasonable price. \\nThis is possible only if the meals are planned in advance. \\n1. Planning in advance helps to determine quantities of different foods accurately. Food buying can  be controlled \\nthrough advance buying because the quantities need to be calculated beforehand. Time and effort spent on \\nhaphazard ordering, shopping and receiving of food materials is saved . \\n2. Planning in advance helps to avoid monotony in the menus; variety in terms of colour, flavour and texture and \\ndifferent methods of cooking could be given due consideration if the menu is planned in time. If the  meal fit the \\nbudget, it cannot be put into practice. Bulk purchasing, including seasonal foods help in this; this  means that menu \\nplanning has to be done in advance.  \\n3. The dietitian is responsible for giving clear instructions to the kitchen staff to ensure harmony am ong the staff \\ninvolved in preparation. This is possible only if the menus are planned in advance.  \\n4. In hospitals, the quantity of nutrients for the day for patients with various diseases and  its distribution between the \\nvarious meals of the day all need due consideration so that the patients are satisfied with the serv ice provided. This \\nis possible only with planning menus. Having u nderstood the rationale for menu planning, we will learn the factors \\nthat affect the food choice. \\n 4.5.2 Factors affecting food choice \\nVarious factors influence our food choices. They are: \\n1. Nutritional Factors \\nFood choices made based on sound principles of nutrition will be conducive to good health while carelessness about \\nnutrition can contribute towards chronic degenerative diseases like diabetes and heart diseases. We do not consume \\nnutrients as such, but as meals/dishes made up of foodstuffs containing t he nutrients in various amounts, knowledge of \\nfood groups will help one to formulate a healthy diet. The various foods in a food group are similar  in a general chemical \\n(nutrient) composition, and hence contribute almost similar types of nutrients to the d iet, although not always in the same \\nproportion.\"),\n",

In the 1940s, nutritionists began \\ntranslating RDA into terms that are more practical so that people with no speci al training in nutrition could still estimate \\nwhether their nutritional needs were being met. \\n A seven-food-group plan was one of the early formats. Daily food choices had to include food from each food group . This \\nplan was simplified into five food - groups. By the mid -1950s, a four -food-group plan was established that included milk \\ngroup, meat group, fruit-vegetable group and bread and cereal group. In 1979, the names of the groups were revised, and a \\nfifth group containing fats, sweets and alcoholic bever ages was added. We need to be cautious while  consuming this last \\ngroup, though it can supply essential fatty acids and vitamin E. \\nThe following discussion briefly summarizes the nutritive value of each of these food groups. Let us begin with cereals. \\n1)   Cereals and Bread Group \\nCereals form the staple of the Indian diet. These grains are the main source of energy in the Indian  diets contributing as  \\nthey do 60 -70% of daily energy intake of majority of Indians. This is because  they are rich sources of carbohydrates. \\nProteins in cereal grains are partially complete as grains are low in one or two essential amino acids - lysine and threonine. \\nHowever, cereals when eaten with pulses, as is the common practice in India, the protein quality imp roves due to m utual \\nsupplementation between the cereal and pulse proteins, the former being deficient while the latter ( pulse) being rich in \\nlysine. Cereals are low in fat, but contain 1-3% omega-3 fatty acids. \\nCereals in general, cannot be considered rich sources of mi nerals. However, ragi is rich in calcium (i.e. 344 mg1100 gm); \\nbajra, and whole-wheat flour are high in iron content. The non-nutrient factors such as phytates, oxalates and fibers, which \\nare present in them, interfere with the absorption of calcium and iron. Cereals, particularly the whole grains, are important \\nsources of B-vitamins. Since most of these vitamins reside in the outermost layer of the grains, they are lost during polishing \\nand refining. Parboiling, which involves soaking in water and subseque nt steaming of paddy, results in seeping of vitamins \\npresent in outer layer into the grain; thus, parboiled milled rice retains much of the vitamins. Cer eals are neither rich in \\nvitamin A nor C; they do not contain any vitamin B12 either; however, whole grain cereals are rich in the other B-vitamins. \\n2) Pulse/Meat, Poultry/Sea Food Group \\nThey are excellent sources of protein, containing 25% protein, but varying from each other in other respects. Let us discuss \\neach of these groups and find out what these differences are: \\n1. Pulse group \\nPulses are rich sources of proteins (20-25 g1100 g), the limiting amino acid being methionine. However, protein quality \\ncan be improved by mutual  supplementation with cereals. Soybean though has exceptionally high protein content  (43 \\ng/100 g). Pulses have carbohydrates in fair amounts.  Pulses are rich in iron, with soybean, cowpea, black gram and \\nhorse gram being exceptionally rich. \\nSprouting or germination of legumes, a practice common in indian households, brings about beneficial  effects. Vitamin \\nC, which is practically absent in dry pulses, increases in significant amounts upon sprouting; folic  acid also increases \\nthreefold. Interestingly sprouting brings about a decrease in flatus -forming compounds originally present in non -\\ngerminated pulses. Sprouted pulses require a much shorter time to get cooked. The anti nutritional factors  such as \\ntrypsin inhibitors, are inactivated by sprouting, thus rendering them more easily digestible. \\n2. Fish and Seafood group \\nThey are rich sources of proteins (20-25%) of a high biological value. Dry fishes contain more (60%) proteins since most \\nof the moisture is lost. Dried fishes have exceptionally high amounts of calcium since it is consume d with the bones. \\nSome varieties of fish such as hilsa, seer, katla, pomfret and mackerel are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are known \\nto protect against cardiovascular diseases. \\n3. Meat and Poultry group \\nMeat and poultry are rich sources of proteins of high biological value.'),\n",

However, egg yolk con tains non-\\nhaem iron; the phosvitin, which is present in egg yolks, interferes with iron absorption but consumi ng vitamin C in the \\nsame meal helps lo overcome this problem. \\n1. Egg yolk is rich in vitamin A and p-carotene, while liver is rich in vitamin A. \\n2. Red meats are rich in saturated fats, while fish and poultry contain very small amounts of fats. Lea n meats \\ncontain less fat. \\n3. Organ meats such as liver, kidney and brain and egg yolks are rich in cholesterol. Including large amounts of \\nsuch foods in the diet, especially along with saturated fats in the diet has been shown to result in  high serum \\ncholesterol, which is a risk factor for coronary heart diseases. \\n4. Flesh foods are rich in iron, zinc and vitamin B12, but are devoid of fibre and vitamin C. \\n1. Dairy/Milk group \\nThis first food of mammals is rich in body-building proteins and bone-forming calcium, besides being the only source of \\nvitamin BIZ for the vegetarians. However, milk does not contain vitamin C, besides being deficient in iron. Dairy milk of \\nvarying fat contents is available in the market, the highest fat milk is known as full fat milk, the next known as standard \\nmilk and the lowest is skim milk. Low fat  dairy milk is better suited for adults, especially the ones who want to watch \\ntheir weights and have a check on their cholesterol levels. Curds are an ideal substitute for people  who have problems \\nin digesting milk due to the deficiency of the enzyme lactase. \\n2. Vegetable-Fruit Group \\nVegetables and fruits add colour and variety to our diets in addition to providing a host of essential nutrients and phyto \\nnutrients that help to prevent chronic degenerative diseases. Fruits are also high in potassium and help to establish a \\nproper balance between the sodium and potassium content of our diets. \\nAn often -neglected group, this group provides for the water -soluble vitamins and minerals, so vital for the proper \\nfunctioning of the body's various mechanisms. These deli cious natural capsules of vitamins and minerals offer \\nprotection against many diseases, especially, heart diseases and certain types of cancer. Most important is the fact that \\nit offers a variety in terms of texture, colour and flavour and thus helps to avoid monotony in the meal.  \\nGreen leafy vegetables are rich sources of various nutrients such as iron, calcium, p -carotene, folic acid and vitamin C. \\nTheir contribution to energy intake is very low, usually less than 2-3%. Yellow-orange coloured vegetables are rich in b-\\ncarotene they must therefore be included at least four to five times in our diets. The citrus fruits  such as oranges, \\nsweet-lime (mosasmbi) and also, papaya and guavas are rich in vitamin C and the yellow -orange ones such as mango \\nand papaya are rich in p -carotene. Fruits with high water content such as melons have low energy content, while dry \\nfruits such as dates and raisins are high in energy. \\n3. Fats, Oils and Sugar Group \\nThis group imparts flavour to the items and thereby improves the palatability. Items incorporating them have a “melt in \\nthe mouth” feeling. The fats and oils are generally the most expensive among the dietary items and t herefore intakes \\nare determined by the economic affordability. A deficit in the intake of fats and oils is rare in the affluent population \\nwhile an apparent surfeit in this group is often responsible for obesity, heart ailments and certain  types of cancers. \\nHence, one needs to use caution in the amounts used.  \\nEach of these groups provides some but not all of t he nutrients. No single natural food supplies all the essential \\nnutrients and the phytonutrients in proper proportions to maintain health, nor is a food group more important than \\nthe other does. A meal plan that includes adequate amounts of foods from the different groups provides the \\nfoundation for good health that needs to be supported by food hygiene, clean drinking water and a clean environment. \\nBesides nutritional factors there are some other factors too which affect food choices.\"),\n",

Other Factors \\nAlthough people are aware and realize that their food choices affect their health, they often choose food f or \\nother reasons. Let us review these factors. \\n1. Personal Preferences: Often people choose foods because they Iike certain flavours. While we Indians enjoy \\nstrong curry spices, the Western cuisine does not include them. Similarly, asafoetida (hing) features in the \\nSouth Indian preparations while garam masala features in the North Indian cuisine. \\n2. Habit: We often select food just out of habit. While idli and dosa feature in South Indian breakfast, parathas \\nfeature more commonly in the North Indian cuisine. \\n3. Social Interaction : Food signifies friendliness. Meals are social events, and the sharing of food is a part of \\nhospitality, Social customs almost compel people to accept food or drink offered by a host or shared  by a \\ngroup.  \\n4. Availability, Convenience and Economy: People eat foods that are accessible, quick and easy to prepare, and \\nwithin their financial means. Many people frequently eat out or have food delivered, which limits food choices \\nto the selections on the restaurant's menu. Seasonal availability of food is particularly important aspect, which \\ninfluences the food choices, particularly for lower income group families. \\n5. Positive and Negative Associations : People tend to associate foods with occasions like sweets during \\ncelebrations and happy occasions (birthdays and festiv als) whereas we often develop a dislike to foods that \\nwe have to eat when we are sick or when forced to eat when not hungry. \\n6. Emotional Comfort:  Some people eat in response to an emotional stimulus for e.g. to relieve boredom or \\ndepression or to calm anxiet y. A lonely person may choose to eat rather than to invite a friend and risk \\nrejection. Eating in response to emotions can easily lead to over-eating and obesity.  \\n7. Body Image: Sometimes, people select foods which they believe will improve their physical appearance and \\navoid those that may be detrimental. Such decisions can be beneficial when based on sound nutrition and \\nfitness knowledge but undermine good health when based on food fads or are carried to extremes. \\n4.5.3 Exchange list vs. food composition table \\nA dietitian is expected to make quick and reasonably accurate estimation of the nutritive value of die ts or calculate diets \\nthat must be controlled for one or more nutrients. The nutritive value can be calculated from the Fo od Composition Tables \\n(given in the Nutritive Value of Indian Foods by Gopalan et. al., NIN, Hyderabad). Initially, dietitians and physicians were \\naware that Food Composition Tables used for calculating therapeutic diets were cumbersome, time -consuming and \\nneedlessly precise and dietitians did not have the time to calculate for each day the energy and nutrient composition of the \\nfood required to fulfill the dietary prescription. Thus, an Exchange List was evolved. The exchange list is a grouping of foods \\nin which specified amounts o f all the foods provide approximately  equal amount of (the same amount) carbohydrate, \\nprotein and fat and hence,  energy content. Specific foods within the group may vary slightly in nutritive value from the \\naverages stated in the group. These differences i n composition tend to cancel out because of the variety of foods selected \\nfrom day to day. Thus, any food within a given list can be substituted or exchanged for any other fo od in that list in the \\ngiven quantities.  \\nFood exchange system allows one to choos e a variety of foods with adequate nutrients. The food exchange system is \\nimportant in planning a nutritious diet. Essentially, the Food Exchange System allows variety in the diets without altering \\nthe energy or the macronutrient contents. The exchange lis ts are especially useful in planning diets for metabolic diseases \\nand are very useful in the management of obesity.  \\n1.   Steps in the Development of Exchange List \\nAs mentioned above, when we group together similar food items so that each supplies a consta nt amount of a particular \\nnutrient, we call the group a food exchange. Given herewith are the steps which when followed, will guide we in developing \\nthe exchange list. It is a difficult task to develop an exchange list for Indian foods as our dishes  defy a ny attempt at \\nstandardization. But anyways we can try. \\n1. The first step in developing an exchange list is the standardization of serving or portion sizes. The portion sizes \\nvary considerably in India. ldlis, dosas, chapattis and puris of different sizes in different states and in different \\nhouseholds. Despite this, portion sizes have been defined.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'producer': 'doPDF Ver 8.9 Build 950', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '2020-03-12T17:24:48+05:30', 'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\saich\\\\OneDrive\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot\\\\Medical-chatbot\\\\data\\\\book 1.pdf', 'total_pages': 141, 'page': 98, 'page_label': '99'}, page_content=\"99 \\n \\n2. The second step is to calculate the energy, carbohydrate, protein and fat content of one serving or portion size \\nof the different dishes. T his can be done by converting the cooked weight of one serving of a dish into raw \\nweight of the ingredients that have gone into it. Although allowances should be made for cooking losses, this \\nhas not been done. Future exchange lists may take care of this. From the raw weights of the ingredients in one \\nserving and using the Indian Food Composition tables, the energy, carbohydrate, protein and fat cont ent of \\none serving can be calculated. \\n3. The third step is to create an exchange list of different dishes in ter ms of standard portion sizes that would \\nprovide approximately the same energy or carbohydrate or fat. Since foods contain widely varying amo unt of \\nthe macronutrients, serving or portion sizes are defined for a group of more or less homogeneous foo ds. For \\nexample, all cereals provide approximately the same number of calories, approximately 350 per 100 g r aw \\nweight and about the same amount of carbohydrates, about 70 g per 100 g raw  weight Therefore, cereal \\nexchanges are grouped together. Similarly, there ar e vegetable, fruits, and milk and meat exchanges. Within \\neach of these food groups, the composition of the different items in terms of carbohydrate, protein and fats \\nremain similar. \\n4. An example is provided in Table 12.2 from a comprehensive exchange list developed by the Lady Irwin College. \\nAnother list, originally developed by the Dietary Department of CMC, Vellore and subsequently added to by \\nmany other institutions; consists of six exchange groups. These are cereals, pulses, milk, meat, fru its and \\nvegetables A and B. A brief review of these exchanges follows: \\n1. Cereal exchange per serving, provides 85 kcal, 20 g carbohydrate and 1.6 g protein \\n2. Milk exchange provides per serving 65 kcal, 4 g carbohydrate, 3 g protein and 4 g fat. \\n3. Meat exchange provides per serving 85 Kcal and varying amounts of CHO, protein and fat. \\n4. Fruit exchanges provide per serving 40 Kcal and 10 g carbohydrate. \\n5. The vegetable A group exchange provides 30 Kcal while the B group provides 30-50 Kcal. \\nUsing the steps elaborated above, we hope  we will be in a position to use the exchange system to calculate a diet pattern, \\nwhich calculates the diet order in kinds and number of servings of food exchanges to be consumed by any individual or a \\npatient each day. Although the exchange system reflect s average and not specific energy and nutrient values, the \\ntherapeutic success that results when the values are used to calculate the diet pattern demonstrate that the method is \\naccurate enough to serve this purpose. An adequate diet, providing all nutrients is needed throughout our lives.  \\nAn adequate and balanced diet is one that meets all the nutrient needs of an individual for maintenance , repair, growth \\nand development. A balanced diet provides all the nutrients in required amounts and proper proportio ns. It can be \\nachieved through maintaining variety in foods and including foods from the different food groups dis cussed above. The \\nquantity of food needed to meet the nutrient requirements vary with age, gender, physical activity etc. \\nRefer to table no.4.5.3a for nutritive values used in dev. of exchange list of cereals. \\nRefer to table no.4.5.3b for food exchanges. \\n4.5.4  Planning a menu \\nGenerally menu planning is done for adults. The term 'adult' refers to any individual in the age group of twenty years a nd \\nabove. The period beginning from twenty years and extending through old  age until the time of death is considered the \\nperiod of adulthood. Adulthood represents the stage in life when an individual has completed higher growth in terms of  \\nbody size. The nutritional need is for maintenance of body functions rather than for growth. \\nAs an individual ages, there is a gradual and progressive change in body functioning. This is becaus e there is an increased \\nbreakdown of tissues while the renewal process is slow . These changes associated with ageing are common to all \\nindividuals, but there is a variation from person to person. In some individuals, the changes become  significant relatively \\nearly, whereas, in other cases these changes appear much later in adulthood. All these factors influence the nutrient needs \\nof adults.  \\n1.  Recommended  Dietary Allowances (RDA) \\nWe already know that recommended dietary allowances, are estimates of nutrients to be consumed daily to ensure the \\nrequirements of all individuals are met in a given population. Growth is no longer an energy-demanding factor in adulthood \\nand BMR is relatively constant among population groups of a given age and gender. Rather habitual ph ysical activity and\"),\n",

These guidelines \\npresented in Tables 12.5, 12.6 and Table 12,7 provide information as to the number o f portions and actual diets that need \\nto be consumed in order to ensure optimal health for Indian adult man and women. These diets, we wou ld notice, are \\nbased on locally available foods within the reach of the people and generally are in conformity with  ou r tradition and \\ncustom.

We have learnt what the recommended dietary intakes are and why these were set up. The recommendations \\nare given for energy, proteins, calcium, iron, vitamin C. thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin A an d vitamin D. \\nThere are variations in RDIs for various age groups, activity patterns and physiological conditions.  RDIs are \\nuseful in planning food needs of catering organizations, detecting deficiencies in food consumption sur veys, \\npredicting deficiencies in food consumption surveys, and organizing food trade. Foods can be classif ied based \\non the predominant nutrients contributed by them. \\n2. A daily food guide has been developed for use in India, taking into account foods available and norm ally used \\nin the Indian diet; the normal meal pattern of Indians and the nutritional needs as indicated by the  \\nRecommended Dietary Intakes (RDI). We learnt about the foods included in each group, the size of serving of \\neach and the minimum number of servings from each group needed to meet the nutritional needs of an \\nindividual. We can use the guide to meet the needs of an individual whose need is hi gher due to strenuous \\nactivities. We have learnt to use the food guide as a tool in planning adequate diets and to evaluat e diets for \\nnutritional adequacy. \\n3. We learnt about the meaning of the term 'menu' and the concept of menu planning. We saw the various \\nbenefits of menu planning and the nutritional and non -nutritional factors affecting people’s food choices. \\nFurther, to facilitate the process of menu planning, we learnt about food exchange  lists and food composition \\ntables. We also learnt the steps involved in the development of food exchange list and planned a few low cost \\nmenus along with their nutritional  analysis, where we saw how meals must be planned based on the \\nimportant nutrients, physical activity, and gender and income level. In addition, we got to have a look at a few \\nsample menu plans along with their nutritional justification.\"),\n",

From the safe protected world in the mother's womb, where it was nourished, the baby \\nnow comes into an environment that places a lot of stress on it. The baby has to make an effort to get the food it needs and \\nhas to cope up with the infections. Breast -feeding is unique because it nourishes the baby and protects it from many \\ninfectious diseases. As the baby grows, mother's milk alone is not sufficient and it will need other baby foods. \\n5.2.1 Growth and development \\nDuring the first year of life, the infant grows and develops far more rapidly than at any ot her stage in life. A number of \\nimportant changes accompany this stage.  \\n\\uf0b7 Physiological Changes \\nThese changes bear important relationship to the care and development of infants. They are: \\n1. Changes in physical development \\n2. Changes in mental development \\n3. Changes in gastrointestinal system \\n4. Development of excretory system \\n5. Changes in body composition \\n6. Changes in feeding behavior \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Growth Monitoring \\nGrowth monitoring is a tool that helps to identify growth [altering at an early stage and helps to institute  corrective \\nmeasures so that malnutrition can he avoided. In growth monitoring, weight is plotted against age accurately on the growth \\nchart. Growth charts are available with all pediatricians, health workers, anganwadi worker and heal th centers. The growth \\nchart depicts vaccination schedule, birth history, general guidelines, disease history and one -year weight record with \\nguidelines of infant feeding. Interpretation of growth charts is very important for any health and nutrition professional. The \\nupward curve indicates weight gain while flat curve indicates no weight gain. The downward curve indicates weight loss and \\nis not desirable. \\nBesides identifying growth faltering, growth charts also provide the following information:  \\n1. The growth is consider ed normal or satisfactory if the curve falls above the topmost line indicating - 80% of the \\nideal weight for age.  \\n2. The growth curve falling between lines indicating 1 and 2 shows that body weight is 71 to 80% of the  ideal, This \\nindicates 1st  degree malnutrition. \\n3. The curve falling between second and third line shows 61 -70% of the ideal body weight. This indicates 2 nd degree \\nmalnutrition. \\n4. The curve falling between third and fourth line shows 50-60% of the ideal body weight. This indicates 3 rd degree \\nmalnutrition. \\n5. The curve falling below fourth line  shows body weight to be below 50% of the ideal indicates 4 th degree \\nmalnutrition. \\n \\nRefer to table no. 5.2.1 for the growth chart of infants \\nThe weight and height is compared with those of well -to-do Indian children as given in Table 5.2.1. It takes 1-3 years for an \\ninfant to establish his own genetic growth pattern. When this figure is established (such as height -for-age or weight -for-\\nage), the child's measurements should then  move along the curve. The first three y ears are crucial, as malnutrition is most \\ncommon and severe during this stage. Height-for-age is a measure of achieved linear growth that can be used as an index of \\npast nutritional status. \\n\\uf0b7 Health Monitoring \\nInfections are a major cause of malnutrition in children. For many of the preventable early childhood diseases, vaccines are \\nnow available so that these diseases of early childhood can be prevented providing a better opportunity for normal growth. \\nAlso known as childhood immunizations  schedule these schedules must be adhered to strictly. Malnutrition, high infection \\nrate, incomplete immunization and poor diarrhea management are major cause of high infant mortality rate (IMR) and \\nunder five mortality rates. Use of ORS and ensuring complete immunization schedule has been able to reduce mortality rate \\nconsiderably.\"),\n",

The growth requirement should be added to TEE to give total energy requirement.  \\nRefer to table 5.2.2a for energy requirements of infants \\n\\uf0b7 Protein:  \\nProtein allowances of infants should meet both growth and maintenance requirements. Protein allowanc es are computed \\nfrom the protein content of breast milk  and the volume of milk consumed by healthy infants growing normally. In case of \\ninfants beyond six months, breast milk alone cannot satisfy protein needs. Supplementary food has to be introduced, \\nconsisting of a source of good quality protein like milk and milk products, cereal and pulse combina tions, non-vegetarian \\nfoods like fish, chick en etc. Hence, protein allowances for infants between 6 -12 months are in  terms of both milk protein \\nand vegetable protein, each contributing almost equally to the total protein intake. \\nRefer to table 5.2.2 b for protein requirements of infants. \\n\\uf0b7 Fats: Adequately breast-fed infants receive nearly 30 g fat per day, of which 10% is linoleic acid and 1% is linolenic \\nacid. Breast milk thus suffices the needs of EFA for infants, which is about 6 -en%, Human breast milk is superior to \\nother milk for its long chain n-6 and n-3 PUFA content that are biologically more potent. \\n\\uf0b7 Calcium: The calcium requirements of young infants are computed from the calcium content of breast milk and  \\nvolume of breast milk intake. Up to 6 months of life, 300 mg calcium intake is adequate. ICMR (1990) recommends \\n500 mg of calcium daily during the entire period of infancy. \\n\\uf0b7 Phosphorus: Phosphorus requirements are linked to the calcium intake and the requirements of both these minerals \\nis .almost equal. However, in all age groups, Ca: P ratio should be 1:1 except infancy when 1:1.5 is recommended. \\n\\uf0b7 Iron: In first two weeks of life, the hemoglobin falls to a normal level of 11 -12 g/d as against 17-23 g/dl at birth. The \\niron is redistributed in the first month of infancy hence breast milk alone mee ts iron needs of infants. Although iron \\nin breast milk is low, it is very well absorbed. Iron fortified complementary foods are important in  maintaining the \\niron status of infants especially in situations where additional iron rich foods are not offered to  the infant after 6 \\nmonths of age.  \\n\\uf0b7 Vitamins: The requirements of both classes of vitamins - fat-soluble and water soluble are given in table 5.2.2.c. \\n\\uf0b7 Trace elements : Most elements, such as zinc and iodine, hold a major significance in infant nutrition. Zinc is \\nassociated with growth while iodine with the brain growth and development. Their significance starts  since \\nconception in the mother and should be adequately provided. \\nRefer to table no. 5.2.2 c for RDAs of various nutrients for infants \\nCompared to adults an infant’s requirements are considerably very high. The RDA table shows the energy requirement of a \\nsedentary man to be 2400 kcal. If we express energy in terms of per kg of body weight, we find that the energy \\nrequirements of an infant (per kg of body weight) are much higher. The need for other nutrients like proteins, vitamins and \\nminerals (per kg of body weight) is also several times more in infants than adults. \\nRefer to table 5.2.2.d for comparison of nutrient needs of an infant & adult \\n5.2.3 Diet and feeding patterns \\nDiet and feeding patterns of infants has been sub -divided into 0-6 months and 6-12 months. Breast milk is best food for an \\ninfant. It is nature's provision to satisfy the needs of the infant for growth and development inclu ding emot ional \\ndevelopment. Even a poorest mother is able to nurse her child satisfactorily at least during the fir st few months. WHO \\nrecommends a normal mother to exclusively breast feed until 6 months of age. \\n\\uf0b7 0 to 6 months: The term exclusive breast-feeding is used when all fluids, energy and nutrients are provided by breast \\nmilk, with the possible exception of small amount of medicinal supplements. Exclusive breast -feeding means that not even \\nwater is given. Breast milk provides enough water even for the hot summer months.  \\nSometimes exclusive breast -feeding cannot be sustained. Working mothers join their duty in the fourth month and \\nexclusively breast -feeding stops. Although infant needs of almost all nutrients are met from breast milk alone but in \\nabsence of bre ast milk, other milk can be given. Giving undiluted homogenized, pasteurized, toned milk that has be en \\nboiled at home is a relatively inexpensive option. Buffalo's milk can be given by initially diluting  in the ratio of 2: l.

The usual challenge in alternate milk is \\nwater quality, hygiene, handling, and milk allergies. Cow milk is known to cause allergies worldwide . Heat -treated milk \\nformulae have shown better tolerance but are expensive and their over-dilution is a major cause of malnutrition. \\nRefer to table 5.2.3a  Nutrient composition of different milks/100 g \\n\\uf0b7 6 to 12 months: As the infant grows older, mother's milk alone is not sufficient to meet his increasing needs. This  is \\nseen in some infants between 4 -6 months by the downward slope in the growth curve. Especially if for some reason, \\nmother's milk is insufficient, the infant is then weaned. Weaning is a process of gradually introducing foods other than \\nbreast milk. Weaning foods are those foods, which are used during the gradual transition of the infant from breas t-feeding \\nto a normal diet. It may start with the introduction of other milk but the best option is to continu e breast milk and give \\nother solid foods in li quid and semi solid consistency. The introduction of complementary foods/weaning foods ensures \\nfulfillment of nutritional requirements and gradually introduces the child to family eating pattern.  By the time the child is  \\none year old, he should get used to eating the normal family diet. \\nBalanced Diet for Infants \\nThe infants aged 6-12 months can eat in a day's diet: \\n\\uf0b7 30-45 of cereal,  \\n\\uf0b7 15 g pulse, \\n\\uf0b7 200-500 ml of animal milk (if breast-fed then 200 ml top milk is recommended), \\n\\uf0b7 50 g roots and tubers, \\n\\uf0b7 25 g green leafy vegetables,  \\n\\uf0b7 25 g other vegetables,  \\n\\uf0b7 100 g fruit,  \\n\\uf0b7 25 g sugar,  \\n\\uf0b7 10 g fat.  \\nAdding extra fat in daI khichri is a recommended practice to ensure 40 en % of fat for infant's growth and decreasing bulk in \\ndiet. \\nRefer to table no. 5.2.3.b for complementary foods for 4 to 12 months infants. \\nFeeding Schedule in Infancy  \\n1) Milk feeding 5 - 6 times/day.  \\nContinue breast-feeding.  \\nExclusive breast-feeding up to 6 months even during illness.  \\nFollow demand feeding. \\n2) 6 months: Start complementary feeding;  \\nFeed 3-4 times/day, example, porridge: twice/day,  \\nVegetable – once/day,  \\nFruit – once/day.  \\n3)       6-9 months: Continue breast-feeding, \\n  Feed 4-5times/day e.g. family diet – twice/day,  \\nCommercial premixes or homemade multi grain mixes including amylase rich foods (ARF) – twice/day,  \\nVegetable/fruits - once a day. \\n4) 9-12 months: Continue breast-feeding, feed family food;  \\nFeed 5-6 times/day  \\nFamily food twice/day, \\nInstant mix – twice/day,  \\nFruits/vegetables - once a day. \\nSource: WCD. Govt. of India. \\n5.3 Childhood \\nAlso known as school age, the school age period can be termed as 'Middle Childhood'. School age children are those who \\nare between 6 and 12 years. After 13 years, children enter their adolescent years. You may call them teenagers. The school \\nage is a serene or calm period because the child has fewer problems than the preschool period or -during adolescence.  The \\nphysical ability of the child improves and makes  the child more skilful. Thus, the child may take more active part in sports.\"),\n",

There is a steady increase in the height and weight. One imp ortant thing in the \\nchild's life is the daily routine of school and many extracurricular activities \\n5.3.1 Growth and development \\nChildren between 6 years and the onset of the adolescence grow relatively slowly. One characteristic  that we notice is that \\nthere is individuality in growth rate of children in these years. There is little growth in head size, but the trunk and legs grow \\n(remember brain growth is completed during the preschool years.) Skeletal maturation occurs during these years. Annually \\nthe increment in height may be approximately 5 to 6cm, with girls gaining a little more than boys do . Weight increases are \\nusually between two and three kilograms per year. \\n5.3.2 Nutrient needs and RDA \\nChildren in this age group have no special nutritional needs. Since children are growing at this age, they require all the \\nnutrients and hence a well-balanced diet. Children who play a lot, and are very active, will need more energy than children \\nof the same age who are less active i.e., one who spends a lot of time in reading, or watching telev ision or painting or \\ndrawing. If the child is getting an adequate diet , he/she will have a low risk of having nutritional problems. However, any \\ninadequacy in a child's diet will affect him/her more q uickly and more severely than it would affect an adult. Blood \\nformation keeps pace with the need for increased blood supply fo r the child's growing body. Children from this age group \\nhave more resistance to disease than the preschoolers. Another important point to bear in mind is that girls should have an \\nadequate iron intake so that they have sufficient iron stores before they reach menarche. Under nutrition may have serious \\nconsequences. If the child is undernourished, he/she will become easily tired and will not be able to perform well in school \\nor be able to do the physical activities well or fully. Such a child may be susceptible to infection as well. \\nRefer to table no. 5.3.2 for RDAs of various nutrients for schoolchildren \\nICMR (1990) gives requirements of 4-6 years and 7-9 years categories. After 10 years of age, boys’ and girls’ are categorized \\ninto three categories i.e. 10-12 years, 13-15 years and 16-18 years. Boys, as compared to girls, have higher lean body mass \\n(LBM), skeletal mass and lower fat as a ratio of total body mass. This difference in body compositio n leads to differences in \\ntheir nutrient needs as LBM has more metabolic activity than adipose tissue.  \\n\\uf0b7 Energy: Occupational and recreational activities variably affect energy requirements. The energy requirements are \\ncalculated for children over five years of age and for  adolescents with lifestyles involving three levels of habitual physical \\nactivity. They are: \\n1. Light physical lifestyles: Children and adolescents who spend several hours at school or in sedentary occu pations; do \\nnot practice physical sports regularly; generally use motor vehicles for transportat ion; and spend most leisure time in \\nactivities that require little physical effort, such as watching television, reading, using computer s or playing without \\nmuch body displacement. \\n2. Vigorous lifestyles : Children and adolescents who walk long distances or u se bicycles for transportation; engage in \\nhigh energy-demanding occupations, or perform high energy -demanding chores for several hours each day; and/or \\npractise sports or exercise that demand a high level of physical effort for several hours, several days of the week. \\n3. Moderate lifestyles: Children and adolescents with habitual physical activity that is more strenuous than the activities \\nfor a light lifestyle, but not as demanding as the activities for vigorous lifestyle have a moderate lifestyle. \\n \\nAs the lifestyles suggest, the intake of calories shall depend accordingly. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Protein: FAO/WHO/UIW (1985) recommends factorial method to compute their protein requirements. The factorial \\nvalue is increased by 50% to obtain the physiological requirements for growth and further 25% has been added to give \\nsafe level of intake. \\n\\uf0b7 Fats: The linoleic acid requirements for schoolchildren and adolescents have been set at 3-en%. In terms of visible \\nfats, ICMR (1990) has recommended an intake of 5-en%. Since their energy requirements are almost equal to adults, \\nthe minimum amount of visible fat works out to be 12 g/d. \\n\\uf0b7 Calcium Calcium requirements in children and adolescents can be calculated based on calcium accretion during  \\ngrowth. In absence of definite data on Indian children and the rate of absorption, ICMR recommended 400 mg for the \\nage group1-9 yrs. Good physical activity, adequate calcium intake and Ca:P ratio of 1:l is recommended for adeq uate \\nbone mass. \\n\\uf0b7 Iron: The maintenance requirements are computed same as adul ts i.e. 14 (g/kg BW). For children up to 12 years of \\nage, the growth and blood expansion requirements are 15 mcg/kg of BW. Thus, 29 mcg/kg BW is recommen ded until \\n12 years of age. Talking into account an absorption figure of 3%, the daily dietary iron requirements are computed for \\ndifferent body weights at different ages of growing child.\"),\n",

In view of high vitamin A deficiency in India \\nand low serum levels, ICMR 1990 recommends 600 mg of retinol to schoolchildren and adolescents. \\n\\uf0b7 Other fat-soluble vitamins: ICMR (1990) does not give recommendations for vitamin D, E and K. Vitamin D is very \\nimportant for skeletal growth and optional utilization or calcium and phosphorus. School children a nd adolescents, \\nwho spend plenty of time in outdoor games in school or home, get vitamin D by bioconversions \\n\\uf0b7 Water-soluble vitamins: Thiamin is computed as 0.5 mg/1000 Kcal, riboflavin as 0.6 mg/1000 Kcal and niacin as 6.6 \\nmg niacin equivalents/1000 Kcal, as is done for adults. Folate requirements are computed on per kg body weight basis \\n.Vitamin B12 requirement ranges between 0.2 -1.0 mcg/d and needs to be ascertained age wise, if any. In absence of \\nprecise data on vitamin C requirements of Indian children and adolescents, a value of 40 mg/d is sufficient for all ages \\n1-18 years and adults. Vitamin C is heat labile and destroyed on storage. Its adequacy is important ev eryday for \\nenhancing availability of iron from diets. \\n5.3.3 Diet and feeding patterns \\nStarting school (especially full-time) can bring a number of changes in a child's eating habits. A large part of the child's time \\nwill be spent in school. Therefore, the meal timings should be adjusted according to the child's schedule. One must see that \\nthe child has a good breakfast. A hungry child cannot concentrate and participate fully in the learning ex perience. Not only \\ncereal but also a protein -rich food and a fruit which supplies some vitamin C should be included at breakfast time. Good \\nbreakfast helps in attention span, good social behavior, sense of security and contentment and prevent snacking and \\nbingeing. Yet most schoolchildren and adolescents rush through their breakfast or completely skip it . One common reason \\nfor skipping breakfast is sleeping l ate and rising-late. Pressure of school routine puts them into a rushed morning routine. \\nThey are not able to regain adequate appetite in this rushed routine in the morning. Adequacy of chi ldren's food and \\nnutrient intake depends on: \\n1.  Sibling company \\n2. Peer pressure \\n3. Model set by parents and other adults in the family their personal attitudes and practices. Sometime  they have \\nknowledge but cannot translate into practice. \\n4. Harmony at home and stress of school \\n5. Mass media \\n6. Convenience foods and fast food outlets. \\n \\nWe often find that a child becomes so involved with other activities that it is difficult to get him /her to sit down and eat. In \\naddition, when we force them they may eat a little and rush back to whatever they were doing. Later they may feel hungry, \\nand want a snack. If we do give snacks, we should encourage the child to eat nutritious ones instead of chocolates or chips. \\nIn the daily diet we must include 2 to 3 servings of fruits or vegetables, green leafy or yellow vegetables about 3 to 4 times a \\nweek. We must make sure that we  include a citrus fruit or some other good source of ascorbic acid. Many ch ildren may \\ndislike vegetables. However, we must try to get them to eat these foods. One way of doing so is by p reparing colorful, \\nattractive, tasty dishes. Another important aspect is that at this age, they may need to eat four or five times a day. \\nPermanent teeth start erupting at about 6 years. One must guard against caries formation in children  at any age but \\nespecially in schoolchildren because they have permanent teeth. Caries formation occurs because of poor dental hygiene \\nespecially after consumption of sweet foods. One  can prevent this by ensuring that the child brushe s and cleans his teeth \\nwell in the morning and night. Also, we must not give too man y sweet foods. For most children, lunchtime is during school \\nhours. We already know that the lunch provides the child with one-third of his/her daily nutrient needs. So most of the time \\nmothers will have to provide a packed lunch for the child.  \\nLet us discuss a few points to keep in mind while planning a packed lunch. \\n1)  It should be easy to eat and not spill over or leak. Avoid any oily or liquid preparations (unless i t is separately \\npackedin a bottle). Oil and liquid will leak out of the box and spill o ver children's books. Chutneys, etc. should be as \\ndry as possible. \\n2)  Let the food be as dry as possible (the child may/may not have a place to sit down and eat and wash hands as he can \\nat home). \\n3)  Many things that taste good when they are hot are not s o tasty when they are cold. A packed lunch will always be \\ncold. Hence, it should be prepared accordingly.\"),\n",

In this period, not only will a \\nboy or girl attain physiological maturity, but the adolescent also becomes increasingly independent and tries to be an adult. \\nThis period in lasts nearly a decade. It is a critical period since development of the indiv idual occurs at the physiological, \\npsychological and social levels. Adolescence is the time that begins with the onset of puberty. At t he end of adolescence, \\nthe individual has functional reproductive organs and has attained final physical growth i.e., wil l not grow any further. \\nPuberty or pubescence begins with the appearance of secondary sex characteristics. In girls, this shows development of the \\nbreast, beginning of the menstrual period etc. In boys, there is development of the genitals, appear ance of the facial hair \\netc. In both sexes, hair begins to grow in the under arms. At the end of puberty, sexual reproductio n becomes possible. \\nAdolescence follows puberty and ends with the completion of physical growth at maturity. Thus, at ad olescence, a girl is \\ncapable of bearing a child. \\n5.4.1 Growth and development \\nWHO defines 10- 18 years children as adolescents. Adolescence is a period of second growth spurt after infancy. Growth \\nspurt refers to a sudden increase in the rate of growth. The rate of growth is not constant in both sexes.  In both sexes, it \\noccurs in spurts. \\nGrowth and development in children can be studied under the following heads: \\n\\uf0b7 Changes in physical development and body composition \\n\\uf0b7 Sexual maturity \\n\\uf0b7 Psychosocial changes'),\n",

Adolescence is a period of second growth spurt \\nafter infancy. Most girls begin the adolescent growth spurt between the age of 10 and 13 years, and boys between the age \\nof 12 and 15 years. Nearly every organ in the body grows during this period of rapid growth. Most noticeable are increas es \\nin height and weight and development of secondary sexual characteristics. During the growth spurt, g irls gain about 25 c m \\nheight and boys 30 cm height. From age 10 years, girls tend to accumulate both lean body mass (LBM) and fat, whereas, \\nboys tend to gain mostly lean tissue. The growth in LBM corresponds to increase in spontaneous physi cal activity in boys \\nand increase in work capacity and heart volume. \\nBoys double their LBM while girls increase by 1.5 fold. Height gain is essentially complete by 19 ye ars. Head size in \\nproportion to total height shrinks from 114\" to 118\" between infancy to adulthood. Growth ceases in girls and boys when \\nskeleton reaches its final size. Once the growth spurt ceases in girls, which is 2 years after menarche, an adequate nutrient \\nintake will help maintain health and lead to increased weight by allowing normal cellular hypertrophy. \\nSexual Maturity \\nSexual maturity develops along with growth spurt in adolescence. In girls, growth stops on attaining  menarche (puberty). \\nThe other changes seen in sexual maturity of girls is development of breasts, axillary hair and pubi c hair. Menarche occurs \\nonly after this growth. In boys, changes in sexual maturity and growth go together. The secondary sexual changes are \\ndeepening of the voice, broadening of shoulders, developing axillary, body and\\' pubic hair. There are distinct changes in the \\nhormones. Sex hormones determine thermo genesis, moods, food intake and body composition. \\nPsychosocial Changes \\nAdolescence is a period of maturation for both mind and body. Along with thephysic4 growth, emotiona l and intellectual \\ndevelopments are rapid. The child develops g radually the ability to reason, develop problem -solving skills, and attain \\nemotional maturity. Adolescence marks a major shift from protected parental care to move into adult life pattern. During \\nthis transition, they try to build self -identity. Adolescent s often feel uncomfortable with their rapidly changing bodies. \\nDeveloping an image of the physical self is intertwined with nutritional issues. There is tremendous  peer pressure. Peer \\npressure and some adult idol determine their food habits, dressing and g roup conduct. There is a tremendous impact of \\nmass media on this age group. \\n5.4.2 Nutrient needs and RDA \\nThis period of growth is less predictable than at other ages, i.e., some teenagers may have their growth spurt at 11-12 years \\nof age and others at 14 y ears. Their requirements are determined by sex and sometimes even within the same sex, age, \\nstage of puberty and growth rate are important factors, which determine the nutritional requirements . Recommended \\nallowances of the Indian Council of Medical Resear ch are based on chronological age. Adolescence is divided into 2 age \\ngroups: 13 to15 years and 16 to 18 years. \\nRefer to Table 5.4.2 for Recommended dietary allowances of nutrients in adolescents \\nIn adolescence, maintenance and growth requirements can be computed separately for energy and protei n. We know that \\nfood and nutrient needs are going to be proportionately higher during the growth spurt. Enough cerea ls and protein \\ncontaining foods like dal s or milk, meat/fish/egg and also leafy vegetables and other fruits and vegetables are very \\nimportant. They provide minerals like calcium, which is important for development of bones and iron for blood formation \\nalong with vitamins A and C. During the adolescent growth spurt (for about 18 to 24 months), when the growth rate is at its \\nmaximum, the nutritional requirements of the teenager may be twice as much as during the rest of the  adolescent period. \\nNutrient requirements of course will parallel their grow th. However, energy requirements as we already know will depend \\nupon the amount of activity the teenager is involved in. During this period the need for all mineral s increases but three of \\nthem are particularly important. They are --calcium (for increased s keletal mass), iron (for the expansion of blood volume) \\nand zinc (for the development of sexual organs and generation of new skeletal and muscular tissue). Girls need more iron \\nthan boys do because of iron losses in blood during menstruation. The best way we can determine whether the teenager is \\nreceiving sufficient nutrition is to see whether he/she is growing well, see whether he/she is eating a well balanced diet and \\nwhether he/she feels healthy and has stamina. If a teenager is constantly falling ill or  feels tired continuously, there is \\nreason to worry. \\n5.4.3 Diet and feeding patterns \\nJust like schoolchildren, adolescents’ adequacy of food and nutrient intake depends on: \\n\\uf0b7 Sibling company \\n\\uf0b7 Peer pressure \\n\\uf0b7 Model set by parents and other adults in the family'),\n",

They are: \\n\\uf0b7  Inanition \\n\\uf0b7 Fad diets \\nInanition actually refers to exhaustion f rom lack of nourishment; starvation. Many teenagers rarely relate today's food \\nhabits to tomorrow's health. They have a notion of 'desirable' body shape and 'ideal' body weight. They purposefully starve \\nto maintain such a weight. Very often they might miss  meals at home, often skipping breakfast and lunch altogether, \\nwhereas during this time of peak growth velocity, adolescents usually need to eat often and in large amounts. \\nOn the other hand, fad diets are common especially among boys. Girls resort to fad diets in order to lose weight and \\nadolescent boys for muscle building, broadening shoulders, waist narrowing etc.  \\nProblems that effect feeding patterns and nutrition are: \\n1. Obesity: One problem is that a diet which consists of high calorie foods only may lead to obesity. If a teena ger is \\noverweight, he/she is made fun of. This may affect the psychological and social maturation of the adolescent. \\nEventually obesity will alter metabolic  function and lead to elevation of blood pressure and raise levels of \\ntriglycerides, glucose etc. leading to high risk of heart disease, when he becomes an adult. \\n2. Acne: Adolescents of both sexes dread pimples and the problems of a bad complexion. There are  many fads and \\nfallacies regarding their causes and treatment. The real cause is that the sebaceous glands which pr oduce oil and \\nlubricate the skin, are under hormonal control. In puberty, hormone production increases greatly thus, leading to \\nacne. The best thing is to have a well balanced diet and combine it with good skin care. \\n3. Alcohol: Teenagers may drink alcohol for fun in the company of friends. What they must take care of is that it should \\nnot become an addiction. Alcohol is not a food. Moreover, it a dversely affects appetite and nutritional status of an \\nindividual. \\n4. Diabetes: A diabetic adolescent (juvenile diabetes) must be given insulin and it is important that he/she is p rovided \\nwith a normal and nutritionally adequate diet. The diet should be satis fying and flexible enough or else the teenager \\nwill find it very hard to adhere to it. \\n5. Teenage pregnancy : Families: who are not financially well off, get their teenage daughters married off at a very \\nearly. As a result, many adolescent girls become pregnant. Nutritional needs during this time should be taken care of \\nso that the pregnant teenager has enough food for her and her baby's growth. \\nWe may encounter adolescents who suffer from other health problems like asthma, atherosclerosis and bone disorders etc. \\nFor each of the conditions we must take adequate and appropriate care under a doctor's guidance so t hat there will be no \\ndetrimental effects on his/her health in the future. \\nSimple nutritious diet, rich in iron, plenty of fruits and vegetables, low fat and low sucrose diet with plenty of exercise and \\nsports can in fact ensure good physique and long term good health. \\nRefer to table no.5.4.3 for balanced diet for adolescents \\nSample items on a menu for an adolescent: \\n \\n \\n1)  Paneer parantha with fruit. \\n2)  Sprout upma/poha with fruit/sprout chat. \\n3)  Missi parantha with vegetable (as carrot, peas, pumpkin, aloo methi). \\n4)  Palak/bathua/methi/missi parantha with oil-free lemon-ginger pickle. \\n5)  Vegetable and peanut idli with chutney. \\n6)  Paneer and vegetable pulao. \\n7)  Vegetable and nugget noodles (avoid plain noodles), \\n8)  Rajma/paneer low fat patties\"),\n",

They occupy a critical place in the life cycle and have health and \\nsocial importance for individuals, families and society. This intergenerational significance has led all soc ieties lo recognize \\nthese as special periods and to make provisions for their care. We shall first discuss about pregnan cy and the impact of \\nnutrition on it.  \\nA normal pregnancy, as you know, lasts for 9 months or 270 days, approximately. During this time, the baby grows from \\nbeing as tiny as a pinhead to a weight of almost 2.5 to 3 kg. During the period of fetal growth in the mother's womb, the \\nfetus is nour ished directly by the mother herself, through a spongy structure called the Placenta. Since the baby  relies \\ntotally upon its mother for nourishment, you realise how vital it is to provide a pregnant woman with an adequate well \\nbalanced diet. \\n5.5.1  Growth and development \\nA completely new life begins at conception. Organ systems develop rapidly and nutrition plays many s upportive roles. \\nPregnancy from conception to birth usually lasts 40weeks (10 lunar months/menstrual cycles) in human s. During this \\nperiod, the unborn child grows from a single cell to an infant that is ready for life outside the womb. Many physical changes \\nalso take place in the mother to support her developing offspring, regulate her own (maternal) metabolism and prepare her \\nfor labor, birth  and lactation. Changes in the mother are anatomical, physiological and complex, affecting almost eve ry \\nfunction of the body. They are an integral part of the maternal - fetal system, which creates the most favorable \\nenvironment possible for the developing child. Many of these changes are apparent in the very early weeks. \\nIt is necessary to conduct biochemical tests at suitable intervals such as in the first, second and third trimesters, to follow \\nthese changes and determine if there is a deviation that cal ls for an intervention. The most common measurement of \\nnutritional importance done routinely in India is hemoglobin in the second and third trimesters. Mea surement of blood \\npressure and fundal height are other two measurements done routinely to determine h igh-risk pregnancies and \\ndevelopment of the fetus.  \\nLot of hormonal changes happen during pregnancy like: \\n\\uf0b7 Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)  begins to increase immediately on implantation of the ovum and reaches a \\npeak at around 8 weeks of gestalion. HCG maintains the corpus luteum which is the main source of oes trogens and \\nprogesterone in the early weeks of pregnancy. \\n\\uf0b7 Human placental lactogen , with a structure similar to the growth hormone, increases throughout pregnancy. \\nPlacental lactogen stimulates lipolysis and is important in maintaining a flow of substrates to the foetus. Placental \\nlactogen along with prolactin also promotes the development of mammary glands. \\n\\uf0b7 Oestrogens and progesterone  are secreted by the placenta from 8 -10 weeks of gestation. It stimulates maternal \\nrespiration ensuring an adequate supply of oxygen to the foetus. 1n addition, it relaxes smooth musc le in the uterus \\nto accommodate the growing foetus and allow for childbirth. Progesterone, while stimulating lobular development in \\nthe breast, inhibits milk secretion during pregnancy.\"),\n",

Cortisol enhances production of \\nglucose from amino acids (gluconeogenesis) and also antagonizes the action of insulin. This way it i ncreases the \\navailability of glucose to the foetus which relies solely on glucose for its energy needs. \\nPlacental Transfer of Nutrients \\nAlso called the lifeline for the foetus, t he placenta is a  transitory structure which develops during pregnancy and lies \\nimplanted on the uterine wall. It is connected with the foetus through the umbilical cord. The foetus derives all its nutrition \\nfrom the mother across the placental barrier. If the consumption, absorption and utilization of the nutrients  by the mother \\nand the transport of nutrients across the placental barrier are inadequate, then foetal malnutrition  develops. Dietary \\ninadequacies are a ma jor cause of fetal under nutrition in developing countries. Maternal diseases such as diabetes and \\nhypertension compromise the delivery of nutrients across the placenta to the fetus. \\nRole of the placenta in fetal nutrition \\n \\nNourishes the fetus \\n \\nRemoves wastes \\n \\nFetal lung \\n \\n \\nProtective barrier \\n \\n \\n \\nEndocrine gland \\n \\nFacilitates transfer of oxygen and nutrients from \\nmother to foetus. \\npicks up fetal waste products such as CO2, urea, \\nbilirubin. \\nperforms the respiratory, absorptive and excretory \\nfunctions that the fetus lungs, digestive system and \\nkidneys will provide after birth. \\nprotects the fetus from harmful agents, which \\nare of high molecular weight including proteins except \\nmaternal immuo globulin G  conferring immunity to the \\nfetus. \\nproduces several hormones t hat maintain pregnancy \\nand prepare the mother's breasts for lactation. \\n \\nMaternal Weight Gain: A  pregnant woman must gain about 7 to 10 kg during the entire pregnancy. Ideally, a mother \\nshould begin her pregnancy at the appropriate weight for her height. It is advisable that during the  first three months, a \\npregnant woman should put on approximately 1 to 2 kg. Thereafter, her weight gain should be at the rate of about 2 kg per \\nmonth. Maternal weight gain represents two major components.  \\n1)    The products of conception i.e. the fetus, amniotic fluid and the placenta  \\n2)    Maternal tissues gained, expansion of blood and extracellular fluid, enlargement of uterus and mammary glands and \\nmaternal stores (adipose tissue).  \\nThese physiological changes contribute towards the increased nutrient demands on the nutritional sta tus of the expectant \\nmother. \\nIn India, the weight gain during pregnancy for the upper economic group is 11kg and, the lower economic group women is \\nonly 6-7 kg. Lower weight gain is associated with increased risk of intrauterine growth retardation and perinatal mortality. It \\nis useful to d efine certain terms here. When a baby is born full term, i.e. 39 -40 weeks of gestation but has a weight less \\nthan 2.5 kg, the baby is referred to as a low birth weight (LBW) baby but if a baby is born prior to full term and weighs less \\nthan 2.5 kg, it is not to be classified as low birth weight or small for date. Such babies are pre maturely born. \\n \\nRefer to Table no.5.5.1 for Distribution of weight gained during pregnancy \\n5.5.2 Nutrient needs and RDA \\n\\uf0b7 Energy: During pregnancy, a woman needs more amount of almost every nutrient. The calorie requirement \\nincreases by 15% or more.  The ICMR has recommended that a pregnant woman's intake should be 300 Kcal more \\nthan her normal intake in the second half of pregnancy. This is because the baby grows very rapidly, in the second \\nhalf of pregnancy.  The composition of the diet during pregnancy should be the same as for a non -pregnant \\nwoman; hence, the contribution to calories from carbohydrat e, protein and fat does not change. However, \\ncarbohydrate intake should not be <100 g per day. Pregnant adolescent girls, underweight women and w omen \\nwho are exceptionally active (heavy physical activity) may require more energy.\"),\n",

This increase could be either through \\nvegetarian sources such as pulses (soybean), milk and milk products (cheese) or through meat/fish an d eggs in the \\ndiet. This is based on the needs of the non -pregnant woman plus th e extra amounts needed for growth. Maternal \\nand foetal growth accelerates in the second month and the rate progressively increases until just be fore term. \\nTherefore, the need for protein follows this growth rate. It is important to ensure protein quality, as well as, quantity. \\nThe physically active pregnant women and adolescent girls would however require more as compared to sedentary \\npregnant woman. \\n\\uf0b7 Micronutrients: Minerals and vitamins are necessary for growth, for formation of red blood cells, formation of bones \\nand teeth and development of the nervous system. Since energy intake increases, the requirements for  few \\nmicronutrients needed for energy utilization i.e. thiamin, niacin, riboflavin and magnesium also inc rease. Since \\nprotein needs are higher, the  requirements for vitamin B6 and zinc also increase.

If a woman has gained more than the expected amount of weight early in pregnancy, she should be advised not  to \\nput on too much weight. However, she should not drastically curtail her diet. It is important to know why weigh t gain is so \\nimportant during pregnancy. She may give birth to an unde rweight baby. This may not be a serious problem if the baby is \\nsmall, alert and healthy. However, a low birth weight baby is usually also malnourished and weak. Su ch a baby may not be \\nstrong enough to get all the nourishment it needs by suckling. It may no t be able to cry loudly and vigorously to attract its \\nmother's attention. If a pregnant woman does not consume enough food early in pregnancy, growth of t he placenta and \\ntherefore the baby's growth may be less than normal. A weak baby girl, when she become s an adult (presuming that she is \\nwell-nourished throughout her childhood) grows to be smaller in stature and so may in turn bear an unders ized or poorly \\ndeveloped infant. Such an infant will not be able to achieve its full potential. Thus, the food that a  woman eats and her \\nnutritional status affect the health of her children and the future of her family. \\n Refer to table no. 5.5.3 Prediction of low birth weight on the basis of BMI of mother \\nDaily Food Guide for the Pregnant Woman \\n \\nFoods \\nNo. of extra servings \\nto be taken by a pregnant \\nwoman \\n\\uf0b7 Cereals and Millets \\n\\uf0b7 Dals/Egg/Milk/Meat/Fish \\n\\uf0b7 Protective Vegetables and Fruits \\n                 (vitamin C rich) \\n\\uf0b7 Dark green leafy Vegetables \\n\\uf0b7 Other Vegetables and Fruits \\n+2 \\n+2 \\n+1 \\n \\n+1 \\n+1\"),\n",

As long as these cravings do not interfere with \\ngood eating habits and are not health hazards, we need not worry about it. Some women crave for amla, raw tamarind, etc. \\nThese foods are nutritious (good sources of vitamin C) and should be eaten. \\nSome women have nausea (feel sick) or morning sickness in early pregnancy. Eating snacks often helps  to prevent and \\novercome this problem. \\n5.6 Lactation \\nLactation is a physiological process, which has profound relevance for b oth the mother and the newborn. It is the period \\nfollowing pregnancy when the woman nourishes a fully developed and a rapidly growing baby with breas t milk. A lactating \\nwoman secretes about 500 ml milk/day in the first month, which increases to about 850 m l/day by the fifth month. On an \\naverage, a well -nourished lactating woman secretes about 850 ml/day. During pregnancy, changes occur in the mother's  \\nbreasts to prepare for milk production and body fat is deposited to ensure that energy is available for lactation. \\nLactogenesis is the onset of copious milk secretion around parturition, triggered by a fall in plasma progesterone  levels. \\nAlthough some colostrums is secreted after delivery (2-3 days), full lactation begins later. The first 2-3 days after delivery is \\na period of rapid lactation initiation, followed by the longer period of maintenance of lactation. T his complex \\nneuroendocrine process is facilitated by interplay of various hormones.  Oxytocin and prolactin instigate the lactation \\nprocess. Prolactin is responsible for milk production and oxytocin is involved in milk ejection from the breast. \\n5.6.1 Human milk composition \\nHuman milk contains several nutrients and that it is tailor made to meet the requirements of the growing infant. Nature has \\ndesigned milk to be species -specific. Thus, human milk is unique to the needs of the young homosapiens. The value of \\nhuman milk for the health and growth of the baby is undisputed and rarely does br eastfeeding need to be discouraged. \\nHuman milk is a solution of proteins, sugar and inorganic compounds in which a variety of fatty acids are suspended.  \\nRefer to table no. 5.6.1 for the nutritional composition of human milk.  \\nMilk composition varies betwe en mothers (inter -individual variation) from one period of lactation to the next (intra -\\nindividual variation) and even within a single 24-hourperiod (diurnal variation) and the time during the feed, as well as, the \\nbreast. The composition of milk is also r elated to the amount secreted, timing of withdrawal and individual variations, \\nwhich includes maternal age, parity, health and socio-economic status. Gestational age of the infant also affects, since milk \\nfrom in others of premature infants has higher concentrations of some nutrients as compared to milk from mothers of term \\ninfants. Similarly, diet and use of oral contraceptives may also influence composition. \\nSpecial characteristics of colostrum, beneficial to the infant are summarized herein: \\n1. Volume of colostrum :2 -10 ml/feeding/day - related in part to the parity of the mother \\n2. Typically yellow, due to a relatively high carotene content \\n3. Transparent, contains more protein, less sugar and much less fat \\n4. Lower in calories than mature milk (58kcal vs. 70 kcal/100 ml) \\n5. Concentration of sodium, potassium, and chloride greater than in mature milk \\n6. Facilitates establishment of 'bifidobacteria' in the gastrointestinal tract of newborn \\n7. Facilitates passage of meconium in the newborn's intestines \\n8. Contains abundant antibodies which provides passive immunity for infant. \\nSome characteristics that make breastfeeding beneficial to the infant are : \\n\\uf0b7 Mature human milk contains about 1/3rd the protein found in cow's milk - more than 25% of its nitrogen is non -\\nprotein nitrogen. The concentration of casein to whey protein is lower; 1.5 for breast milk and 0.2 for cow's  milk. \\nThus, human milk with its low casein content forms a flocculent suspension with a curd tension of 0.  These curds are \\neasily digested and hence better tolerated by the infant. \\n\\uf0b7 Lactoferrin in human milk inhibits the growth of certain iron-dependent bacteria in the GI tract and therefore affords \\nprotection against gastrointestinal infections. \\n\\uf0b7  Protection from respiratory tract allergy and eczema. \\n\\uf0b7 Immunoglobulins provide passive immunity and protect against infection by retarding viral and bacterial inva sion of \\nthe mucosa. \\n\\uf0b7 Relatively low in amino acids that are detrimental at high levels.  \\n\\uf0b7 It  has a threefold higher fat content. Higher content of linoleic a nd oleic acid, cholesterol, the latter being needed \\nfor myelin synthesis. \\n\\uf0b7 Contains lipase which helps in digestion of milk triglycerides and partly accounts for a greater eas e in fat digestion of \\nbreastfed infants.\"),\n",

T herefore, the \\nrelationship between .maternal nutritional status and lactation performance is important. Successful breastfeeding requires \\nadequate nutrition and rest. For adequate lactation, substrates must be available in sufficient quan tities from the mother's \\ndiet or body stores laid down during pregnancy. If these are insufficient, some degree of subsidy from maternal body tissue \\ncan be expected. We know that the simplest evidence of tissue depletion is weight loss. In a sense, pregnancy and lactation \\nneed to be considered as a continuum.  However, the longer the duration of lactation, the greater would be the impact on \\nthe mother's nutritional status. \\nStudies indicate that there are major physiological alterations in calcium and bone metabolism durin g lactation, \\nindependent of maternal calcium intake. Bone resorption and bone formations are high, particularly in the 1st 3-6 months of \\nlactation. \\nAmong well -nourished women, weight loss can occur after childbirth, although this depends on their caloric inta ke and \\ntheir physical activity. In poorer communities, die tary intakes of breastfeeding mothers are not very different from non -\\nlactating women. The RDIs for all major nutrients are given for the first 6 months of lactation, as well as, the second 6 \\nmonths of lactation, when the volume of milk produced has decrea sed. However, women who have a low pre pregnancy \\nweight gain, who have decreased weight for height and who breastfeed more than one infant, need addi tional kilocalories \\nduring lactation. FAO/WHO 2004 recommends that well-nourished women with adequate gesta tional weight gain should \\nincrease their food intake by 505 Kcal/day for the first six months of lactation, while undernourished women and those with \\ninsufficient gestational weight gain should add to their personal energy demands 675 Kcal/day during the first six months of \\nlactation. Energy requirements for milk production in the second six months are dependent on rate of  milk production, \\nwhich are highly variable among women and populations. \\nThe nutrient needs of a lactating mother. \\nEnergy and Protein Needs: Remember that during pregnancy, well-nourished women will have laid down approximately 2-\\n4 kg of fat. This can be mobilized to supply a portion of the additional energy for lactation. It is  estimated that this amount \\nof storage fat will provide 200 -300 Kcal/day for a period of three months. However, this amount represents only a part of \\nthe energy cost of milk production. \\nThe additional protein intake suggested in Table 13.9 not only takes into account the additional pro tein needs but also the \\nnet protein utilization of Indian diets, \\nThe requirement of several micronutrients also increases and is summarized herewith. \\nMicronutrient: Vitamin and mineral deficiencies can have profound influence on the composition of milk. Calcium is a \\nnutrient of special concern, since there are some reports in the literature that if the mother's diet is not adequate, it will be \\nmobilized from her bones. This is especially of concern in case of prolonged lactation. Hence, the R DI for calcium is high for \\nlactating mothers. \\nThe requirements for other nutrients are all increased, reflecting the need for milk production and th e need to replenish \\nmaternal stores. Folate needs are increased above non-pregnant levels but are not as high as during pregnancy. Iron needs \\nare not increa sed during lactation because little iron is lost in milk, and in most women, losses are decreased be cause \\nmenstruation is absent. However, if the mother's iron status is poor, supplements of 30 mg of elemen tal iron per day may \\nbe recommended for the first 2 to 3 months of lactation to replete iron stores. \\nRefer to table no.5.6.2 for RDIs for lactating mothers \\nBesides these, water needs during lactation should be paid attention to. An increase in fluid intake  does not increase milk \\nvolume, however, additiona l fluid is needed to maintain a normal maternal fluid balance. When fluid intake is low, the \\nmother's urine becomes more concentrated to conserve water for milk production. To avoid dehydration  and ensure \\nadequate milk production, fluid intake should be increased by about 1lt per day.\"),\n",

The dietary intake of caffeine, artificial \\nsweeteners and alcohol must be totally avoided. This is because most chemicals ingested by the lactating mother cross into \\nthe milk. Therefore, the mother should seek the advice of her physician before ta king any dietary supplement, medication \\nor drugs. Excess caffeine may make the infant irritable and wakeful, but the research indicates that  moderate amounts of \\ncaffeine (1 -2 cups of coffee per day) will not harm or upset the infant. Further, infants metab olize alcohol inefficiently. \\nSmoking also reduces milk volume. Infant exposure to passive smoke negates the protective effect of breastfeeding and \\noffers against sudden infant death syndrome. \\nFoods with a strong flavour may alter the flavour of milk. A few  infants may be sensitive to particular foods like cow's milk \\nprotein. Hence, when the mother's diet includes such foods, the infant may experience discomfort. In  general, the mother \\ncan eat whatever she likes. However, if she suspects that a particular fo od is causing the infant discomfort, she should \\nconsult the physician. If the food is eliminated for an extended time, appropriate foods should be s ubstituted to ensure \\nnutrient adequacy. During the period of nursing or breastfeeding one can notice that a mother needs to consume one-and-\\na-half times her normal food intake.  \\nSample menu for a nursing mother \\nFoods                                                                                         Amount \\nChapati or                                                                                         One \\nRice                                                                                                    One cup \\nDal or                                                                                                 One cup \\nEgg or                                                                                                One \\nMilk/curd or                                                                                     One cup \\nFish or                                                                                                One piece \\nNuts                                                                                                   25 gm \\nAny dark green leafy vegetable                                                    One serving \\nGhee/butter/oil/fat                                                                         4-5tsps \\nSugar/jaggery                                                                                   4-5tsps \\n \\nWe are familiar with the traditions of feeding special preparations to a nursing mother. Many communities give a nur sing \\nmother kheer or laddus made from dry fruits, methi, lobia, leafy vegetable soups, etc. All these foo ds provide energy, \\nproteins, minerals and vitamins that the mother needs. \\nIt is not always necessary to prepare such foods. We can meet the additional requirements of the mot her by increasing \\nsome common food items in the normal diet which provide the same nutrients. \\n5.6 Old age \\nAgeing is a continuous process. It starts at birth and continues throughout our life. This process though is hastened in later \\nyears of life. \\nHere we will focus on the vital relationship between nutrition and ageing discuss the current nutrit ional recommendations \\nfor healthy ageing. One of the fundamental and unavoidable facts of life is that our body composition changes with age. It \\nchanges from the way it looks to the way it functions. Externally, the hair greys, skin wrinkles, eyes and ears also go through \\ntheir own degeneration. Inte rnally, many physiological changes occur and practically all the tissues and organs decline in \\ntheir functional efficiency over time. Also no two persons of sixty or sixty -five years look alike. Some may look ten years \\nyounger, others a few years older than they are. In other words, their actual age, which is also known as chronological age, \\ndoes not coincide with their biological age. However, the chronological age is most often used by ge rontologists to define \\nthe aged. In India, a cut-off age of 60 years is taken for classifying people as 'old' and is used for census purposes. \\nMany nations follow the cuts off age at 60 years while many developed countries and United Nations take the cut-off age at \\n65 years to designate the elderly. In India, socio-economic development along with better health facilities and medical care \\nincluding primary health services has raised the life expectancy. At present, the elderly constitute  7.7% of the total \\npopulation i.e. approximately 76 million and are projected to reach ab out 150 million (12 percent) by the year 2025. The\"),\n",

We can class ify the elderly into \\ntwo groups, the 'young old' (i.e. 60 to 74 years)  and 'old old' (i.e. 75 years plus) , Men outnumber women in young old age \\ngroups and women outnumber men in the higher old ages. The Indian population projections reveal an i mpending burden \\nof elderly care in the near future. Our health planners will have to give more attention to the prev entive and health \\npromotion for the elderly. This would help to improve their quality of life and reduce morbidity lev els so that they live \\npurposefully and independently within the community. \\n5.6.2 Changes in ageing \\nAs we grow older, our body is the sum total of the care, use, misuse or neglect it has undergone. Th e illnesses or diseases \\nthat we may have suffered also leave their mark. If we had accidents, the cumulative effect of these  on the body is also felt \\nin old age. Infections like diarrhea, dysentery, fevers etc. that we may have suffered due to environmental factors also leave \\ntheir mark on certain systems of the body. How well the need of the body was met by foods we ate thr oughout the years \\naffects not only the ageing process, but also our resistance to disease. \\n\\uf0b7 Physiological changes: Many changes occur in our body, mind, social and economic status with age.  The digestive \\nsystem undergoes considerable change with age. The amount of acid and digestive enzymes secreted by gastric  glands \\ndecreases. Thus, the digestion and absorption of nutrients is decreased. About 10 per cent of the elderly suffer from \\nreduced secretion of hydrochloric acid or gastric acid. This takes away the first line of defense of the body, since gastric acid \\nacts as an antiseptic also. As a result, they suffer from frequent diarrhea and stomach upsets due to increased infections. \\nThe movement of the alimentary tract becomes sluggish with age. Food stagnates, bowels do not move regularly and \\nconstipation is a common problem. It may have been treated with drugs over a period, further reducin g its activity. Proper \\nmastication helps the process of digesti on of food but with teeth fallen, decayed or functionless, food is often swallowed \\nthan chewed by the elderly. If they have poorly fitted dentures, they do not use them due to discomfort. The ability to smell \\nand note differences in taste reduces with age, which leads to decreased enjoyment of food. The progressive accumulation \\nof plaques leads to narrowing of the lumen of blood vessels and loss of elasticity. There is a decline in the cardiac output, an \\nincreased resistance to the flow of blood and resultant reduced capacity to respond to extra work. As the rate of blood flow \\nis reduced, the digestion, absorption and distribution of nutrients is retarded. Skeletal bone loss occurs with ageing and \\nmay have serious consequences among the elderly. With ageing,  there is thinning of bone tissues due to the loss of these \\nminerals. In some elderly, there is an abnormal thinning of bone tissue and as a result, osteoporosis develops. \\nFrom age 25 years, the basal metabolism decreases by about 2 percent for each decade due to the increasing proportion of \\nbody fat and lesser muscle tension. The ability to maintain normal body temperature is also lessened  and hypothermia in \\nthe elderly can be especially dangerous. \\nCarbohydrate metabolism: Glucose tolerance may be impaired to some extent. \\nUsually, the fasting blood sugar is normal. The absorption of carbohydrate is not impaired, however,  when a carbohydrate \\nload is presented, as in the glucose tolerance test, the blood sugar remains elevated for a longer period of time as \\ncompared to the younger persons. \\nFat metabolism: With increasing age, the blood cholesterol and blood triglyceride levels gradually increase. Certain  factors \\nlike the kind and amount of fat and carbohydrate in the diet, the degree of overweight, the stresse s of life may be \\nresponsible for the elevated levels. \\nChanging body composition: By 80 years, it is estimated that only half of the muscle cells remain. Connective tissue, which \\nis so abundant in the human body, sees many changes, which are of special sign ificance. Collagen is one of the fibrous \\nmaterials found in tendons, ligaments, skin and blood vessels. With ageing, the amount of collagen i ncreases and becomes \\nrigid, the skin loses its flexibility, the joints creak and the back becomes bent. Both longit udinal and cross-sectional studies \\nthroughout the world indicate that height decreases with age. The average reduction in height during  the total life span is \\nabout 2.9 cms in men and 4.9 cms in women, with approximately half the decrease being in sitting height. The reduction in \\nsitting height is a result of vertebral compression, change in shape and height of vertebral discs, loss of muscle tone and \\npostural changes. Weight loss in elderly is generally caused by a reduced lean body mass (LBM) and b ody fat  due to \\nmetabolic and physical changes associated with ageing or presence of disease conditions. The body wa ter content reduces \\nwith advancing age and this has been implicated as an important cause of decline in weight after 65 years. Studies also \\nshow a slow, progressive redistribution of fat in the elderly. The body fat relocates centrally and intra a bdominally, while \\nthe subcutaneous fat on the limbs tend to decrease. An increase in abdominal circumference with age may also reflect \\nshortening of trunk d ue to osteoporosis or other spinal deformities. As the length of the trunk decreases, the abdomen \\nincreases in girth.\"),\n",

A \\nconsideration of recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for older adults must recognize each of these  aspects of the \\nrelationship between nutrition and ageing. The Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) gradually decreases after the attainment of \\nmaturity due to a decrease in muscle mass tissues and physical activity. With an increase in age, the percentage r eduction \\nin the total energy requirement as recommended by \\nICMR is 20 percent for 60 to 69 years of age and 30 percent for 70 to 79 years of age and above, although there can be wide \\nindividual variations. The elderly need the same nutrients that they needed earlier. One change that definitely accompanies \\nthe ageing process is a decreased energy need. With age the basal metabolism and activities slow dow n. On an average, \\nmen and women in the 55 -75 years age group need 400 to 500 calories less per day than they did before this stage. The \\nneed for other nutrients is not altered. Therefore we do not find changes in recommendations for nutrients except energy. \\nRefer to table no.5.6.2a  for recommended dietary allowances of nutrients for the elderly \\nThe metabolic demand for vitamin B, to maintain glucose tolerance and \\nnormal cognitive function in older adults is higher than the earlier consumption. Vitamin B6 and vitamin E supplementation \\nhelp to enhance the vigor of immune reactions which slow down with age. The efficiency in absorption  of vitamin B12 and \\nfolic acid in the gut may be reduced with age owing to the decrease in secretion of hydrochloric aci d in t he stomach of \\nmany elderly people. The capacity of the skin to synthesize vitamin D from sunlight and also kidney' s ability to convert \\nvitamin D to its biologically active form, declines with ageing process. \\nThe potential benefits of micro nutrients should  also be taken into account when the nutrient allowances are defined for \\nolder adults. The increase in the status of vitamin B6, BI2 and/or folate gives protection against elevations in homocysteine \\n– an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, d epression and certain deficits of neuro-cognitive function. A good \\nnutritional status of vitamin C, E and b-carotene (antioxidants) among healthy elderly have shown a reduced risk for cancer, \\ncataract and heart disease. \\nNutrients act as modulators of chronic disease risk. Therefore, it is more important for .the elderly to consume a diet rich in \\nantioxidant nutrients (vitamin A, C and E and selenium), B vitamins (folate, vitamin B6 and B12) and minerals like calcium, \\nto prevent chronic disease, rather than consuming just the amount of nutrients that are needed to prevent a deficiency \\nstate from occurring. Strong links which have been made between specific nutrients and particular chronic illnesses. \\nRefer to table no.5.6.2 b for interactions between specific nutrients and chronic illness \\n5.6.4 Diet and feeding patterns \\nBalanced diets for elderly \\nThe key element in planning diets for the elderly should be nutrient-based dietary guidelines, in order to reduce the burden \\nof chronic disease afflicting this group by nutr itional means. The adults over 70 years generally consume less food than \\nyounger people primarily because of decrease in energy expenditure and distinctly different metaboli c processes. It is \\nimportant to note the following: \\n1. Foods that are nutrient dense in vitamins and minerals should be included. For example, whole grain and enriched or \\npossibly fortified bread should be preferred to refined grain products for provision of adequate amo unts of B \\nvitamins. This is especially important since cereals and bread comprise the bulk of the diet of elderly people, many of \\nwhom are at risk for malnutrition. \\n2.  In the fruit and vegetable category, deeply colored ones should be chosen for provision of folate an d antioxidant \\nnutrients. \\n3. In the milk and milk products group (curd, paneer, cheese) emphasis should be placed on low fat dairy products for \\nthe provision of adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D. \\n4.  From the protein rich group of meat, poultry, fish, beans, eggs and nuts groups, variety should be the key principle  \\nto follow with individual choices being made according to availability, affordability, chew ability,  individual and ease \\nof preparation. \\n5. Foods high in dietary fiber should be given and fluid intakes of elderly people should be emphasized  since thirst \\nsensation is decreased in older people. \\n6. For non-vegetarians, pulses can be exchanged for eggs or a portion of chicken or fish.\"),\n",

Due to \\nrestriction in calories, nutrient dense foods should be included in them to meet the nutrient requirements. \\n\\uf0b7 Small frequent meals, which are easy to prepare and digest, should be given. \\n\\uf0b7 The taste acquisition and sensation of smell decline in later years, so some pleasure derived from f ood is lost. It is, \\ntherefore, advisable that the meals should be made more attractive and appealing by including a variety of foods and \\ncolor to encourage or motivate them to eat. Every effort should be made to make food palatable, with out using \\nspices in excess. , \\n\\uf0b7 Overuse and sprinkling of table salt over preparations while eating should be avoided by the elderly. \\n\\uf0b7 Loss of teeth due to increased decay of teeth and gums is common in aged person. Ill fitting dentures may also make \\nchewing difficult. A change in the texture and method of food preparation is recommended. Consequent ly, well \\ncooked and soft meals must be included in the diet. Care must be taken to avoid too much of soft car bohydrate-rich \\nfoods and include foods that provide nutrients such as vitamins, proteins and minerals like calcium. \\n\\uf0b7 There is decreased secretion of saliva, which makes swallowing difficult. \\n Therefore, soups, vegetables with gravies, curds or raitas, dals etc.should be included in the meals  and very dry \\nmeals should be avoided. \\n Gastric acidity decreases with age. Peptic, tryptic, amylolytic and lipolytic activities of the digestive secretions are \\ndecreased. Reduced acid secretion and muscle weakness leads to delayed esophageal emptying, poor tol erance to \\nfat, distention, flatulence and constipation. A liberal intake of fibre and fluid (at least 8  glasses of water or non \\nalcoholic caffeine free beverages) should be consumed by an elderly .person to facilitate the digest ion process. \\nRoughage in the form of tender vegetables and fruits is beneficial against the problem of constipation.'),\n",

This \\nmay lead to anemia and may contribute to osteoporosis. Iron and calcium -rich food should be included in the daily \\ndietary intake. Elderly people also have to make a conscious effort of drinking water in order to remain well hydrated \\nespecially in warm climates. This is because their thirst mechanism is reduced with an increase in age. This also helps \\nto overcome the problem of constipation, which is a very common complaint during this age. \\n\\uf0b7 Energy intake should be sufficient to maintain normal weight without leading to obesity or weight lo ss. Under \\nnutrition is undesirable and on  the other hand obesity may lead to diabetes, coronary heart disease, gout and other \\ndegenerative disorders. \\n\\uf0b7 Small meals at frequent intervals should be consumed. Fats, oils, refined cereals and sweets should be consumed by \\nthe elderly. Dietary fat, if poorly tolerated may be reduced. \\n\\uf0b7 Elderly need more calcium, iron, zinc, antioxidant nutrients like b -carotene, vitamin E and C to prevent age -related \\ndiseases. Inadequate diets of the elderly may need to be supplemented with pharmaceutical nutritiona l \\nsupplements. \\n\\uf0b7 The likes, dislikes and food preferences of the elderly should be considered while meal planning. Am ong elderly who \\nsuffer from chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertensions or heart disease, further dietary modifica tions may be \\nrequired. \\n\\uf0b7 Alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking should be completely avoided. \\n5.7 Summary \\n\\uf0b7 We learnt that infancy is one of the most rapid periods of growth in life. Human milk is ideally sui ted to the needs of \\nthe human infant. It is important to feed colostrum to the i nfant. In order to nurse her baby successfully, a mother \\nshould consume atleast one-and-a-half times her normal diet. After 5 to 6 months of age, milk alone is not sufficient \\nfor the baby's needs. Other foods, like semi-solids should be introduced into the infant's diet at this age. By one year \\nthe child should be able to eat most of the foods that are eaten by adults. When it is not possible to feed a baby with \\nmother's milk, cow's or buffalo's milk, can be used after suitable modification. \\n\\uf0b7 Growth in the s chool years occurs at a slow but steady pace. Except in the early school years, appetite of the \\nschoolchild is quite healthy. Nutrient requirements are in proportion to their growth rate and energ y requirements \\nand will vary according to their physical activity. If the schoolchild is malnourished, he/she will not be able to perform \\nwell in school. Providing adequate nutrition is important so that the child will be able to build up adequate nutrient \\nreserves, which will be needed during the adolescent growth spurt. \\n\\uf0b7 Adolescence is a period of rapid growth at the end of which the individual reaches physiological mat urity and is also \\nsexually mature. Differences in body composition, weight and height between sexes and between indivi duals of the \\nsame sex will bec ome apparent. Nutrient needs in this period are in accordance with the needs for growth. \\nPsychological and emotional factors may affect food intake in this age group. Peer pressure and lack  of awareness \\nregarding nutritional needs may lead to consumption o f nutritionally inadequate diet. Problems related to teenage \\nobesity, sports activity, marriage and diseases like diabetes may affect growth and nutritional stat us of the \\nadolescents. \\n\\uf0b7 During pregnancy, changes in both the mother and the fetus necessitate i ncreased intakes of nutrients needed for \\ngrowth. A pregnant woman should gain about 7 to 10 kg during the entire nine months. She should eat foods which \\nare rich in vitamins, minerals and proteins in addition to lots of carbohydrates and good fat. Malnu trition during \\npregnancy affects the developing baby. It may lead to a woman delivering prematurely or a low birth weight. \\nCurtailing dietary intake or unbalanced diets during pregnancy should be avoided. Fluid intake and c onsumption of \\nvegetables and fruits should be ample and normally salt should not be restricted. \\n\\uf0b7 We learnt about the nutritional needs of the elderly, and in doing so we have also focused on many o ther aspects \\nsuch as the definition of elderly, what is an ageing process and the impact of nutritional status on the health of older \\nadults. We studied about physiological changes in the body systems and based on these nutritional re quirements of \\nthe older adults. The guidelines for planning balanced nutrient dense diets for them were also outlined. \\n There are special considerations to be kept in mind while planning menus for them and these have been pointed out.\"),\n",

It has received wide appreciation from the general public as well as \\nfrom students of nutrition, medicine, home science, nursing and allied subjects, and \\nhas been reprinted several times. It has also been widely disseminated through \\noutreach activities undertaken by the National Institute of Nutrition, in the form of \\nlectures, exhibitions and distribution of materials in various local languages. \\nIn the intervening years, there have been notable socio-economic changes in \\nIndia. It was thought necessary to update the guidelines in the light of new \\ndevelopments and fresh information. \\nThe most notable change has been in the overall economic scenario in the \\ncountry, with a robust growth rate. There have also been some important \\ngovernment initiatives in the fields of health and nutrition and poverty alleviation, \\nincluding the launching of MGNREGA and overhauling of the ICDS. Globalisation \\nhas resulted in the opening of multinational fast food chains in Indian cities, \\nincluding the smaller cities. Lifestyles and dietary patterns that had started giving \\nearly warning signals towards the end of the previous century, when these \\nguidelines were first published, are continuing to follow a trend that promotes \\nobesity and the attendant non communicable diseases. \\nThe improvement in the overall economy at the macro level and concomitant \\nimprovements in purchasing power (though unevenly distributed) among \\nhouseholds have not led to the expected levels of improvement in the nutritional \\nstatus of Indians. The latest findings of the National Family Health Survey, NFHS-3 \\nshowed virtually no improvement in parameters as compared to NFHS-2, and \\nrecent surveys by the National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau have thrown more \\nlight on the growing problem of the 'double burden' of undernutrition and \\novernutrition. These data should serve as a wake-up call to nutritionists and policy \\nmakers. There is very obviously an 'awareness and information deficit', even \\namong the more affluent sections of the population, about good dietary practices \\nand their linkage with good health. This deficit should be narrowed and eliminated \\nby harnessing all traditional as well as modern technological vehicles of \\ncommunication. \\nThis updated version of DGI from India's premier nutrition institute, National \\nInstitute of Nutrition, should serve as a valuable source of concise, accurate and \\naccessible information, both for members of the general public and those who are \\ninvolved in dissemination of nutrition and health education. \\n- Dr. C.

The economic transition has \\ntransformed the way people live. Changing lifestyles of people both in rural and \\nurban areas are seen to alter the very structure of our society at a rapid pace today. \\nThe shift from traditional to 'modern' foods, changing cooking practices, increased \\nintake of processed and ready-to-eat foods, intensive marketing of junk foods and \\n'health' beverages have affected people's perception of foods as well as their dietary \\nbehaviour. Irrational preference for energy-dense foods and those with high sugar \\nand salt content pose a serious health risk to the people, especially children. The \\nincreasing number of overweight and obese people in the community and the \\nresulting burden of chronic non-communicable diseases necessitate systematic \\nnutrition educational interventions on a massive scale.

A proper \\ndiet is essential from the very early stages of life for proper growth, development \\nand to remain active. Food consumption, which largely depends on production and \\ndistribution, determines the health and nutritional status of the population. The \\nrecommended dietary allowances (RDA) are nutrient-centred and  technical in \\nnature. Apart from supplying nutrients, foods provide a host of other components \\n(non-nutrient phytochemicals) which have a positive impact on health. Since \\npeople consume food, it is essential to advocate nutrition in terms of foods, rather \\nthan nutrients. Emphasis has, therefore, been shifted from a nutrient orientation to \\nthe food-based approach for attaining optimal nutritional status. Dietary guidelines \\nare a translation of scientific knowledge on nutrients into specific dietary advice. \\nThey represent the recommended dietary allowances of nutrients in terms of diets \\nthat should be consumed by the population. The guidelines promote the concept of \\nnutritionally adequate diets and healthy lifestyles from the time of conception to old \\nage. \\nFormulation of dietary goals and specific guidelines would help in providing \\nrequired guidance to people in ensuring nutritional adequacy. The dietary \\nguidelines could be directly applied for general population or specific physiological \\nor high risk groups to derive health benefits. They may also be used by medical and \\nhealth personnel, nutritionists and dietitians. The guidelines are consistent with the \\ngoals set in national policies on Agriculture, Health and Nutrition. \\nThe dietary guidelines ought to be practical, dynamic and flexible, based on the \\nprevailing situation. Their utility is influenced by the extent to which they reflect the \\nsocial,  economic, agricultural and other environmental conditions. The guidelines \\ncan be considered as an integral component of the country's comprehensive plan to \\nreach the goals specified in the National Nutrition Policy. \\nThe major food issues of concern are insufficient/ imbalanced intake of \\nfoods/nutrients.

Recent evidences \\nindicate that undernutrition in utero  may set the pace for diet-related  chronic \\ndiseases in later life.

Emphasis is on positive recommendations which \\ncan maximize protective effects through use of a variety of foods in tune with \\ntraditional habits.  The higher goals set with respect to certain food items such as \\npulses, milk and vegetables/fruits are intended to encourage appropriate policy \\ndecisions. Suitable messages for each of these guidelines have been highlighted. \\nA variety of foods, which are available and are within the reach of the common \\nman, can be selected to formulate nutritionally adequate diets. While there are only \\nfour accepted basic food groups, in India, there are a variety of food preparations \\nand culinary practices.  Different cereals/millets are used as staple food, apart from \\na variety of cereal/millet/pulse combinations in different regions of India. The \\ncooking oils and fat used are of several kinds.

India has been classified by the World Bank \\n1\\nas a country with a lower middle income, with per capita GNP of US $ 996-3945 . It \\nth \\nranks 160  in terms of human development among 209 countries. Among the Indian \\npopulation, about 28% in the rural and 26% in the urban areas are estimated to be \\n2\\nbelow the poverty line , which is defined as the expenditure needed to obtain, on an \\naverage, 2400 Kcal per capita per day in the rural areas and 2100 Kcal in urban \\nareas. Long-term malnutrition leads to stunting and wasting, non-communicable \\nchronic diet related disorders, increased morbidity and mortality and reduced \\nphysical work output. It is a great economic loss to the country and undermines \\ndevelopment. \\n     Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM), micronutrient deficiencies such as vitamin A \\ndeficiency (VAD) , Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA), Iodine Deficiency Disorders(IDD) \\nand vitamin B-complex deficiencies are the nutrition problems frequently \\nencountered, particularly among the rural poor and urban slum  communities. \\n     Undernutrition starts as early as during conception. Because of extensive \\nmaternal undernutrition (underweight, poor weight gain during pregnancy, \\nnutritional anaemia and vitamin deficiencies), about 22% of the infants are born with \\n3\\nlow birth-weight (<2500 g) , as compared to less than 10% in the developed \\ncountries. Both clinical and sub-clinical undernutrition are widely prevalent even \\nduring early childhood and adolescence. Though the prevalence of florid forms of \\nsevere PEM like kwashiorkor and marasmus among preschool children is <1 %, \\nnational surveys indicate that about half of (48%) <5 year children suffer from sub- \\nclinical undernutrition such as underweight (43%) stunting and wasting (20%) which \\n3\\nindicates that undernutrition is of long duration . The studies have shown that there \\nis a steep increase in the prevalence of underweight with increase of age, from 27% \\n4\\nat 6 months of age to a high of 45% at 24 months of age . This is attributable to faulty \\ninfant and young child feeding practices prevailing in the community. \\nPersistent undernutrition throughout the growing phase of childhood leads to \\nshort stature in adults.  About 33% of adult men and 36% of the women have a Body \\n2\\nMass Index (BMI) [Weight in kg/(Height in meter) ] below 18.5, which indicates \\n4\\nChronic Energy Deficiency or CED (Table1) . In the case of vitamin A deficiency, 0.8- \\n1% of preschool children show the signs of Bitot's spots and night blindness.  \\nVitamin A deficiency also increases the risk of disease and death. \\nCommon Nutrition Problems \\n3\"),\n",

The most important consequence of iodine deficiency in mothers is \\ncretinism in which the children suffer from mental and growth retardation right from \\nthe birth. About 90,000 still-births and neonatal deaths occur every year due to \\nmaternal iodine deficiency.  Around 54 million persons are estimated to have goiter, \\n7\\n2.2 million have cretinism and 6.6 million suffer from mild psycho-motor handicaps . \\nIndia is passing through the phase of economic transition and while the problem \\nof undernutrition continues to be a major problem, prevalence of overnutrition is \\nemerging as a significant problem, especially in the urban areas.

The child requires prompt correction of fluid and electrolyte loss \\nusing oral rehydration solution (ORS) along with appropriate/adequate feeding. \\nORS can be prepared by adding a pinch of salt (between thumb and index finger) \\nand a teaspoon of sugar to a glass of potable water. Home-made fluids such as rice \\nkanji  or buttermilk with salt can also be used. During infections, children should \\nfrequently be given small quantities of fluids by mouth, including plain water.  During \\ndiarrhea, feeding should be continued, though this goes against the popular \\npractice. Breast-milk promotes sodium and water transport across the gut and, thus, \\nprevents dehydration and weight loss, in addition to providing other nutrients.  \\nThe diet of 1-2 year old children with diarrhea should provide energy of about \\n1000 Kcal/day. Calorie-rich, semi-solid, soft diets may be prepared from a variety of \\ncereals and pulses. Sprouted grains are easily digestible and provide good nutrition. \\nFat and sugar help in reducing the bulk of the diets and make them energy dense. \\nMilk may be mixed with cereal diet to avoid lactose malabsorption. If milk is not \\ntolerated, it may be replaced by an equal volume of curd/yogurt/soymilk. Mashed \\nvegetables may be incorporated in the diet. Feeding becomes easier after the \\ninfection subsides. About 6-8 feeds should be given during the day so that the extra \\nfood (120-140 Kcal/kg) may be consumed by the child without any difficulty. \\nDeficiency of the enzyme lactase leads to lactose intolerance. During acute or \\nchronic diarrhea, lactose intolerance is a mild and transient problem. This problem \\ncan be overcome by reducing the quantity of milk taken at a time or taking milk along \\nwith a cereal-pulse meal. There is no need to stop milk in acute diarrhoea. In chronic \\ndiarrhea, some children may develop lactose intolerance. In such children, milk may \\nbe stopped temporarily. A diet based on cereals and pulses or chicken and egg white \\nallows the gut to recover and milk can then be slowly introduced. Adequate feeding \\nduring and after diarrhea prevents malnutrition. \\nTake extra care in feeding a young child and include soft cooked \\nvegetables and seasonal fruits. \\n/c125Give plenty of milk and milk products to children and adolescents. \\n/c125Promote physical activity and appropriate lifestyle practices \\n/c125Discourage overeating as well as indiscriminate dieting. \\n/c125\\n36 \\nPOINTS TO PONDER'),\n",

It \\ncontains most of the nutrients necessary for growth and development. It is, \\ntherefore, specially useful or feeding infants, toddlers, growing children and \\nexpectant women and nursing mothers. All the macro and micro-nutrients are \\npresent in an easily digestible and assimilable form in milk. Milk proteins possess \\nhigh biological value which is almost equal to that of meat, eggs and other high- \\nquality animal proteins. Milk proteins are valuable supplements to most vegetarian \\ndiets. \\nMilk is a rich source of bioavailable calcium which helps in the building up of \\nstrong bones. Milk fat serves as a vehicle for important fat-soluble vitamins A, D and \\nE. Since, milk fat is of the saturated type those who have to be on a low fat diet can  \\nconsume skimmed/toned milk. For strict vegetarians, milk is the only source of \\nvitamin B . Milk is also rich in riboflavin, but is a poor source of vitamins C and iron. 12 \\nHowever, only pasteurized or boiled milk should be consumed to ensure protection \\nfrom disease-causing agents. \\nLactose, the sugar present in milk, helps in the establishment of lactic acid \\nbacteria in the intestinal tract. If lactase, an enzyme required for digestion of lactose, \\nis not present in sufficient amounts, such individuals develop abdominal symptoms \\non consumption of excess of milk. This is common in children following diarrhea and \\nis described as lactose intolerance. Drinking small quantities of milk at a time does \\nnot usually cause any gastrointestinal problems and there is no need to discourage \\nintake of milk by children except in severe cases of diarrhea. \\nSoft drinks are generally of two categories, natural soft drinks and artificial or \\nsynthetic soft drinks. Water is the main constituent of all beverages. Orange, lemon, \\ngrape, mango, pineapple and apple are generally used in making fruit juice. sugar \\ncane juice is also extensively used in India, particularly during summer. Natural fruit \\njuices provide in addition to energy, some vitamins (beta-carotenes, vitamin C) and \\nminerals (potassium, calcium). Fruit juices being potassium rich are ideal \\nbeverages for those suffering from hypertension. However, they cannot be equated \\nwith fruits which also provide dietary fibre. \\nCompared to natural fruit juices, synthetic drinks do not contain nutrients unless \\nthey are fortified. Generally, synthetic drinks are prepared using preservatives, \\nartificial colors and flavors such as cola, orange, mango and lime, and mostly they'),\n",

This characteristic \\nstimulating effect is due to their caffeine content. A cup (150 ml) of brewed coffee \\ncontains 80-120 mg of caffeine and instant coffee 50-65 mg, while tea contains 30- \\n65 mg of caffeine. Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system and induces \\nphysiological dependence. \\nGenerally, low doses (20-200 mg) of caffeine produce mild positive effects like a \\nfeeling of well-being, alertness and being energetic. Higher doses (>200 mg) can \\nproduce negative effects like nervousness and anxiety, especially in people who do \\nnot usually consume caffeine-containing beverages. Therefore, moderation in tea \\nand coffee consumption is advised so that caffeine intake does not exceed the \\ntolerable limits. Tannin is also present in tea and coffee and is known to interfere with \\niron absorption. Hence, tea and coffee should be avoided at least for one hour before \\nand after meals.    \\nExcess consumption of coffee is known to increase blood pressure and cause \\nabnormalities in heart beat. In addition, an association between coffee consumption \\nand elevated levels of total and LDL cholesterol ('bad' cholesterol), triglycerides and \\nheart disease has been demonstrated. Therefore, individuals with heart disease \\nneed to restrict coffee consumption. Also, those who experience adverse effects \\nfrom caffeine should stop drinking coffee.  \\nBesides caffeine, tea contains theobromine and theophylline. These are known \\nto relax coronary arteries and thereby promote circulation. Tea also contains \\nflavonoids and other antioxidant polyphenols, which are known to reduce the risk for \\ncoronary heart disease and stomach cancer. However, as a result of its caffeine \\ncontent, excess tea consumption is deleterious to health.

Beer contains \\n2-5% and wine 8-10% of alcohol, while brandy, rum and whisky contain much higher \\nconcentrations (30-40%). Alcohol has been extensively abused as an appetite \\nstimulant and as a sedative-hypnotic drug. Alcohol intake, which is initiated as an \\ninnocent social habit may gradually result in a serious addiction. It may lead to \\nseveral serious psycho-social problems and accidents.  \\nAlcohol provides higher calories (7 Kcal/g) than \\ncarbohydrates and proteins and thus, can contribute \\nto obesity. Ironically, excessive intake of alcohol is \\nknown to suppress appetite and interfere with \\nabsorption and metabolism of nutrients, leading to \\nvarious nutritional deficiency diseases.  \\nExcessive intake of alcohol suppresses appetite \\nand as a result, leads to several nutritional deficiency \\ndiseases. People who regularly consume more than \\ntwo alcoholic drinks (one equals about 30 ml of \\nethanol) are at a higher risk for hypertension and stroke. Alcohol intake has also \\nbeen shown to increase the risk of cancer of the mouth, larynx and oesophagus, \\nprostate and of the breast in women.

Their contribution in terms of essential nutrients depends on the type of \\nprocessing and fortification, the frequency of use, and the quantity consumed.  \\nProcessed foods are generally refined and a majority of them are rich in fat or in \\nsalt/sugar, and are calorie dense. They lack dietary fibre and micronutrients. Thus, \\ncaution needs to be  exercised when processed foods constitute a major part of the  \\nmeal. \\nBreakfast cereals are increasingly being used in urban areas. Traditional \\nbreakfast items like idli, dosa, upma  and roti  are rich sources of nutrients. Puffed and \\nparched rice products (eg. flaked rice) besides being crisp and tasty, are easily \\ndigestible. Food items like chips, candies, peppermints, chocolates, etc., which are \\npopular among children, are considered as unhealthy since, they provide only  \\nempty calories often containing artificial colors and other additives. Their use should \\nbe discouraged. \\nInstant foods are those, which undergo special processing designed to dissolve or \\nto disperse particles more rapidly in a liquid than the untreated product. For instance, \\ninstant noodles, soup powders, cornflakes fall under this category. Although all \\ninstant foods need not be unhealthy in terms of high calorie or salt contents, there are \\nconcerns about the presence of certain additives like monosodium glutamate, which \\nmay also add up to the over-all sodium intake from the foods. \\nFast foods are foods already made or cooked to order within minutes for \\nconsumption like noodles, burgers, fried fish, milk shakes, chips, salads, pizzas, \\nsandwiches, etc. Storage, handling and microbiological contamination are the major \\nconcerns. Further they are calorie dense foods. \\nStreet foods comprises of a wide range of ready-to-eat foods and beverages \\nprepared and/or sold by vendors and hawkers, especially on streets and other public \\nplaces.

Certain pesticide residues can effectively be removed by blanching.  \\nBut before blanching it is very important to thoroughly pre-wash the vegetables and \\nfruits.  \\nPeeling \\nContact pesticides that appear on the surface of the fruits and vegetables can be \\nremoved by peeling. Steps such as concentration, dehydration, and extraction from \\nthe raw product can further reduce pesticide residues in the end produce.

Define Food, Nutrition & Health \\n2. Explain the interrelationship in maintaining good health & wellbeing. \\n3. List the parameters for maintaining Primary Health Care. \\n \\n \\n \\nWe all know that food is a basic necessity.This unit tells you about food and some of its components.  \\nYou will also be introduced to the terms nutrition and health.Food is any substance consumed to provide \\nnutritional support for an organism. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, \\nsuch as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. \\n \\nFoods are made up mostly of bio- chemicals which are mainly derived from living sources such as plants \\nand animals. There are three main groups of constituents in foods: Carbohydrates, Protein and Fats and \\nderivatives of these\\n. The essential substances contributed by our food are called nutrients. If these \\nnutrients are not present in our food in sufficient amounts, the result is ill health and in some cases, \\neven death. Food also contains many substances, which are non -nutrients e.g. colouring, and flavouring \\nsubstances in food. Food is therefore, a complex mixture o different nutrients and non-nutrients. \\nFUNCTIONS OF FOOD: Food consists in part of various nutrients. These nutrients can be classified into \\nfive major categories (based on certain similar features): proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitami ns and \\nminerals.Food also has social and psychological functions in addition to physiological ones. \\nPhysiological Functions: The physiological functions performed by food are the energy -giving, body -\\nbuilding, protective and regulatory functions. The energy -giving function of food is basically performed \\nby two nutrient categories-carbohydrates and fats. This is why these nutrients are also referred to as the \\n“body fuels”.Food is also needed for growth and repair. For both growth and repair, proteins are \\nnecessary.The other major physiological functions performed by food are the protective and regulatory \\nfunctions. Let us talk about the meaning of the term ‘protective’ first. Here protective refers to the role \\nin preventing infection by ensuring proper functio ning of the body systems responsible for fighting \\ninfections. \\nThe regulatory function mentioned earlier refers to the role of food in controlling body processes. \\nSeveral processes take place in the body such as the beating of the heart, maintenance of body  \\ntemperature and contraction of muscles. Each of these processes is controlled. This is achieved by \\ncertain specific nutrients and is illustrative of their regulatory function. Vitamins, minerals, and proteins \\ncontribute substantially to both protective and regulatory functions. So does water. \\nSocial Functions: Food and eating has significant social meaning. Sharing food with any other person \\nimplies social acceptance. When you share a meal with anyone else, you are expressing your acceptance \\nof friendship and respect for that person. Food is an integral part of festivity anywhere in the world. \\nStudy Material'),\n",

Certain food items such as \\nfruits, sweets and coconuts are  offered to the deity in temples. Often sweets are prepared at temples \\nand gurudwaras and distributed to devotees as a benediction or Prasad. Food thus becomes an integral \\npart of the social and religious life of people. \\nPsychological Function: We all have emotional needs such as the need for security, love and attention. \\nFood is one way through which these needs are satisfied. Food is also closely allied to our emotions. \\nFood often serves as a reward. On the other hand, certain foods become associated with sickness such \\nas khichri (a rice-dhal porridge). This type of food is generally eaten when a person suffers from fever \\nand may, therefore, not be associated with pleasant feelings. \\nNutrition: Nutrition is a scientific discipline with food as the major focus of interest. It can be defined as” \\nThe science of foods, the nutrients and other substances therein, their action, interaction  and balance \\nin relationship to health and di seases; the process by which the organism ingests, digests, absorb, \\ntransports and utilizes nutrients and disposes of their wend products.” \\nThe body needs each nutrient in specific amounts. Some are needed in relatively larger amounts -the \\nmacronutrients, and some in smaller amounts -the micronutrients. Each nutrient plays a significant role \\nin the body and a balance should be maintained. The term balance means that the nutrients needed by \\nthe body should be provided in the right amount and proportions. \\nNutrients are the constituents in food \\nthat must be supplied to the body in suitable amounts. These include carbohydrates, fats, proteins, \\nminerals, vitamins and water. Chemical substances obtained from food and used in the body to provide \\nenergy, structural materials and regulating agents to support growth, maintenance and repair of body’s \\ntissues. Nutrients may also reduce the risks of some degenerative diseases. \\nLet’s study different aspects of nutrition. \\n1. Social and cultural aspects of eating:  Food has a special meaning in the social and cultural \\ncontext. Our ancient vedic tradition emphasizes food as the life-giver. It further attributes \\nspecific qualities to specific foods. It is important to keep a person’s socio -cultural background in \\nmind whenever we talk of improving or modifying food related practices. \\n2. The psychology of eating: The individual reactions to food and to the people around us can have \\na significant psychological influence on our eating pattern.Many factors influences our choic es \\nof foods such as advertisements and the attitude of other people around us. \\n3. The economics of food: Food costs money. It must be within the reach of people and it must be \\nequitably distributed to all sections of the populations. The availability of food and its proper \\ndistribution is of great importance. It is the coordinated effort of planners, farmers, suppliers \\nand consumers of food products to ensure equitable distribution of food products. \\n \\n \\n \\nStudy Material'),\n",

Health is a positive state of complete \\nwellbeing and not just absence of disease. One dimension, which is  also gaining prominence, is spiritual \\nhealth. Let us now examine each of these dimensions of health.  \\n1. Physical health: The physical dimension of health is familiar to us. Physical heal is easy to detect \\nand describe. A person is physically healthy if he or she looks alert, is responsive, energetic and \\nvigorous. \\n2. Mental health: Mental health is a more complex concept than physical health. It implies freedom \\nfrom internal conflicts and a good capacity to adjust to situations and people. Physical and mental \\nhealth are inter -related. Physical ill health can lead to mental ill health. The reverse can also \\nhappen. \\n3. Social health: An individual who recognizes his/her obligations towards other members of society \\nand is able to relate to other people around him/her can be described as socially healthy. It is \\nimpossible to realize the goal of social health if mental health has not been achieved. Similarly, a \\nperson who does not enjoy physical health would find it difficult to achieve social health. \\n4. Spiritual health: Spiritual health is the most difficult to define. The concept of doing good and not of \\nnot harming there: of believing in the basic forces of goodness and justice whether or not these are \\nworshipped as God: of recognizing the needs of other and trying to fulf il them: of commitment, duty \\nand obligation, these are all characteristics of a spiritually well person. \\n \\nPrimary Health care \\nPrimary health care is a whole-of-society approach to health and well-being centred on the needs and \\npreferences of individuals, families and communities.

One prominent example of a basic unit is glucose. \\n• Food sources: The list includes cereals and millets, roots and tubers, some fruits, sweeteners like \\ncane sugar, jaggery and honey. Cereals and millets are the major source of carbohydrates in \\nIndian diets. All cereals like wheat, rice and millets contain considerable amount of starch. \\n• Functions: Some of the important functions of carbohydrates are energy -giving, protein- sparing \\naction and utilization of fats.though proteins can be broken down in the ody to meet the energy \\nneed,but an insufficient amount of carbohydrates in the diet will f orce the body to break down \\nproteins for releasing energy. Some amount of carbohydrate is needed for the proper utilization of \\nfat in the body. \\n \\nProteins: \\nProtein is the most abundant component in the human body. It is made up of compounds called amino \\nacids, which are also referred to as the building block of proteins. The linkage of individual amino acids \\ntogether in long chains forms proteins . The quality of food protein depends on the proportion of essential \\nand non-essential amino acids. Those amino ac ids which cannot be manufacture by the body are called \\nessential amino acids and those which can be manufacture by the body are called non- essential amino \\nacids. Proteins can be divided into essential and non- essential .Proteins are essential to all life. In animals, \\nthey help form supporting and protective structures such as cartilage, skin, nails, hair and muscle. They are \\nmajor constituents of enzymes, antibodies, many hormones and body fluids such as blood, milk, and egg \\nwhite. Protein value of some common foods is listed below: \\n \\nFOOD AMOUNT PROTEIN IN GRAMS \\nChicken 1 breast(120gm) 22 \\nMilk 1 cup(150ml) 4.8 \\nEgg 1 medium size 7 \\nPaneer 40gm(4 big piece) 9.64 \\nAlmonds 100gm 20.8 \\nDals 25gm (1 bowl) 5 \\nSoya Bean 25 gm (1 bowl) 10.8 \\nPeanut Butter 1 table spoon(15gm) 4 \\n \\n• Food sources: Some of the rich sources of protein are milk, milk products, flesh foods, eggs, nuts \\nand oilseeds, cashew nuts and pulses. \\n• Functions: Some of the functions of proteins are body -building, regulation, protection acts as \\ncarrier molecules and energy giving molecules. \\nFats & Oils: \\nFats are a group of chemical compounds that contain the fatty acids. They are composed of the fatty acids \\nand glycerol. They do not form long molecular chains, and they do not contribute structural strength to plant \\nand animal tissues. Fats are smooth, greasy substances that are insoluble in water. Fat is mainly fuel \\nStudy Material'),\n",

Macronutrients include carbohydrates, proteins, \\nfats, macro minerals and water. \\nMicronutrients are vitamins and trace or microminerals. Vitamins and trace \\nminerals are labelled as micronutrients because the body  only requires them \\nin very small amounts generally less than 100mg/day. They have preventive \\nand therapeutic role in our diet and don’t provide any energy.

So, what do we mean by the term \"Nutrient Requirement\" here? \\n The requirement for a particular nutrient is the minimum amount that needs to be consumed to \\nprevent symptoms of deficiency and to maintain satisfactory level of the nutrient in the body.  \\nFor example in case of infants and children, the requirement may be equated with the amount \\nthat will maintain a satisfactory rate of growth and development. Similarly for an adult the \\nnutrient requirement is the amount that will maintain body weight and prevent the depletion of \\nthe nutrient from the body which otherwise may lead to deficiency.  In physiological condition \\nlike pregnancy and lactation, adult women may need additional nutrients to meet the demand of \\nfetal growth along with their own nutrient needs. \\nNow within each group (say infants or an adults etc)  there may  \\nbe individual variations in the nutrient requirements.  For instance,  \\nthere may be a period of low intake or the quality of the diet may  \\nvary,  similarly the effect of cooking and processing may be different \\n and  bioavailability of the nutrient from the diet may also vary.   \\n \\nSo how do we account for this? Well a safety factor is added over and above the nutrient \\nrequirement for each group to arrive at the Recommended Dietary Allowances. \\nBioavailability refers to the \\nrelease of nutrient from the \\nfood, its absorption in the \\nintestine and bio-response \\nStudy Material'),\n",

RDA takes into \\naccount the variability that exists in the requirement of a given nutrient between individuals in a \\ngiven population group. So RDA is neither minimal requirement nor necessarily optimal level of \\nintake. Rather, RDA is the safe and adequate level, which incorporates margin of safety intended \\nto be sufficiently generous (high enough) to encompass the presumed variability in requirements \\namong individuals and  meet the needs of almost all healthy people.  \\nFurther please note, RDA's do not apply to people who are suffering from disease which \\ninfluence the nutrient intake. They only apply to healthy people. \\nNext we shall review the significance, uses of RDA's.   \\nSIGNIFICANCE/USES OF RDA \\n RDA, we know, represents the level of the nutrient to be consumed daily to meet all the \\nrequirements of most of the individuals in a given population. So RDA's help us plan balanced \\ndiets which include a variety of foods derived from diverse food groups which help meet the \\nnutrient requirements. Other than this basic use, RDA's have come to serve many important \\npurposes. The various applications of RDA include: \\n• Comparison of individual intakes to the RDA allows an estimate to be made about the \\nprobable risk of deficiency among individuals, \\n• Modifying nutrient requirements in clinical management of diseases, \\n• To help public health nutritionists to compose diets for schools, hospitals, prisons etc.  \\n• For health care policy makers and public health nutritionists to design, develop nutrition \\nintervention programmes and policies, \\n• For planning and procuring food supplies for population groups, \\n• For evaluating the adequacy of food supplies in meeting  national nutritional needs, \\n• For interpreting food consumption records of individuals and populations, \\n• For establishing Standards for the national feeding programmes implemented by the \\nGovernments for its vulnerable population, \\n• For designing nutrition education programmes for the masses, \\n \\nREQUIREMENT  + SAFETY MARGIN   = RECOMMENDED DIETARY INTAKE \\n \\nStudy Material\"),\n",

Next let us learn about the \\nRecommended Dietary Allowances for Indians.  \\n \\nRecommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for Indian Population \\nFor the Indian population, the dietary standards have been computed by the Indian Council of \\nMedical Research (ICMR). These recommendations have been published as \"Nutrient \\nRequirements and Recommended Dietary Allowances for Indians\" (ICMR 2010) \\nThe recommendations are constantly revised whenever new data is available. The last \\nrecommendations were revised in 2010, based on the new guidelines of the International Joint \\nFAO/WHO/UNU Consultative Group and based on the data on Indians that had accumulated \\nafter 1989 recommendations. Table 1(a) and Table 1(b) present these recommendations. Study \\nthem carefully. To help you understand these recommendation here are a few highlights: \\n1. Note, the RDA for Indians are presented for the different age categories: 0-6 months, 7 to \\n12 months, 1 – 3 years, 4 – 6 years, 7 – 9 years, 10 – 12 years, 13 – 15 years,16 – 18 \\nyears, adult man and women..   \\n2. Recommendations are given for energy and all other nutrients including proteins, visible \\nfat, calcium, iron, retinol, Beta Carotene, thiamine, riboflavin etc.  \\n3. Recommended dietary allowances for adults are based on sex (male, female), body \\nweight and physical activity level (i.e. Sedentary, Moderate and Heavy work) . \\n4. RDA for energy is expressed in kilocalories (Kcal), for proteins, fats in grams (g), and for \\ncalcium, iron, vitamins and minerals in milligram (mg) or microgram.  \\n5. RDA for protein is based on body weight. The relationship can be expressed as 1g protein \\nper kg body weight in the case of adults. It varies for other age categories. \\n6. RDA for energy and protein are given as additional intakes in pregnancy and lactation, \\nindicated by a ( \" + \" sign). This requirement is over and above the normal requirement of \\nadult women. RDA for other nutrients are given as total intake figures. \\n7. In infancy RDA\\'s for energy, protein, iron, thiamin, riboflavin and niacin are expressed as \\nper kg body weight (expected for a healthy, normal growing infant of a particular age) \\n8. RDA for Vitamin A have been given in terms of retinol or alternatively in terms of Beta \\nCarotene. \\n \\nStudy Material'),\n",

You will learn to apply \\nbasic knowledge of food and nutrition that you have already acquired earlier. Good health \\nand well being of a family is relat ed to the sensible selection of food items in the daily diet. \\nLet us now learn how to plan a healthy, joyful and satisfying meal for the family by \\nunderstanding the basic concepts of meal planning.  \\nWHAT IS MEAL PLANNING \\n \\n          You may have heard in you r home from your mother that planning for meals saves time and \\nmoney. Now you will  understand the concept of  planning a balanced diet  to plan a nutritious \\ndiet for your family.  \\nConcept of meal planning -Meal planning involves planning nutritious meals for all individuals \\nin a family keeping in mind their age, activity, likes, dislikes and food availability. It also involves \\nplanning of balanced meals which are colorful, attractive, appetizing, and palatab le and within \\nthe economic means of the individuals concerned. It further involves decision making regarding \\nwhat to eat and how much to eat each day at each meal. The meals planned should not only \\nensure that nutrient requirements are adequately met but a lso be flexible enough to take \\nadvantage of easy availability and lower prices of seasonal foods and meet the needs and \\nchoices of the family members.  \\nAs the health of an individual or a family depends on how well they are fed within the given \\nresources, effective meal planning is a great challenge to every meal manager, and if done well \\nis a satisfying and rewarding experience. \\nImportance of meal planning \\n         Meal planning helps to: - \\n• Retain, enhance nutrients and minimize nutrient loss -Meal planning is done in a way that the \\nmeals are prepared and served at fixed meal times without too much holding or reheating which \\nhelps to retain the nutrients.  \\n• Introduce variety and avoid monotony -Variety can be introduced by using different ingredients \\nchosen fr om different food groups, using various textures, cooking methods, spices and \\ncondiments, etc. \\nStudy Material'),\n",

For example, potatoes for dosa  and \\nsamosas can be boiled, peeled and cut together, if meals are planned. \\n \\n• Plan low cost n utritious meals within the resources-Careful planning can help save money by \\nbuying seasonal foods and cheaper substitutes that have same nutritive value. \\n \\n \\n• Meet the individual nutritional requirements -Meal planning can help meet  the individual needs \\nof all the family members, the same common meal can be modified to suit any member suffering \\nfrom an ailment. \\n \\n• Reuse the left over  in a  novel way -Careful planning can ensure no food is left over. Also, any \\nleftover can be incorporated  in the next meal in an interesting manner, without compromising on \\nthe quality. For example, left over rice can be used to make rice pudding, cutlets, lemon rice, etc. \\n       FACTORS AFFECTING MEAL PLANNING  \\nGood meal planning is both a science and an art.  Science shows us the way to include nutritious foods \\ninto diet, while art is involved  in converting raw food  item into meals that are attractive, delicious and \\nsatisfying in all ways. \\n \\n        Following are the factors which should be kept in mind when planning meals for a family- \\n \\n1. Nutritional Needs- When planning a meal the major factor to keep in mind is that the meal \\nmust fulfill the nutritional requirements of family members.   \\n \\n2. Economic factors- The purchase of food items and their quantity depends on the total income of \\na family. \\n \\n3. Size and composition of the family \\n \\n(i) Size of the family- Size of a family refers to the total number of its members. The   structure \\nof the family whether nuclear or joint also affects the meal planning. \\n \\n (ii) Family composition-Family composition refers to the age, gender , activity, occupation, and \\ndifferent physical conditions of its members. \\n \\n4. Season- Meals should be in accordance to the season. With the  change in season, availabi lity of \\nfoodstuffs and our taste also change. In summers, bottle gour d, ridge gourd, pumpkin, bitter \\ngourd, etc. are available in abundance while carrots, radish, peas, cauliflower, etc. in winters.  \\nStudy Material'),\n",

Food availability- Availability of food also affects the meal planning. A housewife should make \\nmaximum use of locally produced foo dstuffs because they are cheap and tasty. For example, \\npeople living in coastal areas consumes more seafood as it is easily available and cheap Including \\nmango or watermelon in diet is of no use in winter if it is not available.  \\n \\n6.  Food acceptance- Acceptance or rejection of food by a person is affected by his likes and \\ndislikes, reli gious and social traditions and customs. All these factors are to be kept in mind \\nwhile planning a meal.  \\n \\n7. Availability of time, energy and labor saving devices- Meal planning is greatly affected by \\navailability of time, energy and labor saving devices with the housewife. This is important in \\nthose cases where the housewife is also working.  \\n8. Occasion- Different occasions such as birthday, anniversary and festivities may have special \\nmenu to celebrate the importance of the occasion. \\n9. Appearance of food \\n• Color should be attractive. Avoid a menu of all white, yellow or greens colored food. Example-\\nyellow dal with pumpkin vegetable. \\n• Include contrasting textures like soft foods and crisp food. \\n• Bland and spicy flavors both should be combined. \\n• Different shapes may be used like round, flat, shredded, sliced or diced, cubes, etc. \\n \\nBALANCED DIET\\n \\nIn the previous chapter you have already studied about five food groups. Now will learn to  incorporate \\nvarious food groups in terms of nutritional quality and quantity in p lanning a balanced diet for a person. \\nLet us now understand and define a balanced diet. \\n Balanced diet- A balanced diet is one which provides all the nutrients in required amounts and proper \\nproportions. It can easily be achieved through a blend of the fiv e basic food groups. The quantities of \\nfoods needed to meet the nutrient requirements vary with age, gender, physiological status and physical \\nactivity.  \\nBalanced diet also has a provision for extra nutrients which can be reserved in the body to enable it to \\nwithstand short periods of low dietary intake. Hence it is very important to judiciously choose and \\ncombine variety of food stuffs from each food group. \\n \\n \\nStudy Material'),\n",

During intrauteri ne development, \\ninfancy, and childhood, for example, recommended intakes of macronutrients and most \\nmicronutrients are higher relative to body size, compared with those during adulthood. You \\nwill be surprised to know that young children require a higher energy compared to body size \\nto help physical and mental development. On the other hand, inactive senior citizens need \\nlower energy than other adults to maintain their weight and stay healthy.                     \\n         \\nNUTRITION DURING INFANCY (0-1 YEARS)   \\n \\n          Infancy is called as earliest part of childhood. During the first year of life, good nutrition is \\nessential to healthy growth and development. It is the period from birth to one year of age. \\nInfancy is characterized by rapid physical and soci al growth and development; many changes \\noccur that affect feeding and nutrient intake.  Infants are entirely dependent on their parents or \\ncaregivers for providing them with nourishment. The first year of life is also a time of great \\nnutritional change for the child, from a diet consisting entirely of milk to one consisting of a \\nvariety of foods. Optimal nutrition has a greater importance during this time of life than during \\nany other because of its effect on brain growth, the development of the nervous system, overall \\ngrowth and development, and future health. According to World Health Organization (WHO) \\nfigures the average weight of the healthy new born is around 3.2 kg. A healthy baby doubles \\nhis birth weight by six months and becomes three times by one ye ar of age. The normal birth \\nlength of 50-55cm also increases by another 23-25cm during the first year. \\n         NUTRIENT NEEDS OF INFANTS \\nEstimates of energy and nutrient needs in infancy are summarized in the Table - . . These \\nvalues are recommended by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), India, 2010.

Childhood is the time for children to be in school and at play, to grow strong and \\nconfident with the love and encouragement of their family and an ext ended community of caring adults. \\nEating a balanced diet and regular exercise is essential for all individuals, but particularly for school -aged \\nchildren. Poor nutrition compromises both the quality of life of school -aged children but also their potential \\nto benefit from education. Good nutrition of school aged children will also make sure they grow to their full \\npotential, and provide the stepping stones to a healthy life. The best nutritional advice to keep children \\nhealthy includes encouraging them to eat breakfast every day. \\nThe World Health Organization  (WHO) defines an adolescent as any person between ages 10 and 19. \\nAdolescents also undergo a very rapid growth during their puberty (called the  pubertal growth spurt ). The \\nnutritional requirements of young people are influenced primarily by the spurt of growth that occurs at \\npuberty. The peak of growth is generally between 11 and 15 years for girls and 13 and 16 years for boys.  The \\nnutrient needs of individual teenagers differ greatly, and food intake can vary enormously from day to day, \\nso that those with deficient or excessive intakes on one day may well compensate on the next. In this period \\nof life, several nutrients are at greater deficiency risk including iron and calcium. \\nIron \\nAmong adolescents, iron-deficiency anaemia is one of the most common diet -related deficiency diseases. \\nAdolescents are particularly susceptible to iron deficiency anaemia in view of their increased blood volume \\nand muscle mass during growth and development. This raises the need of iron for building up haemoglobin, \\nthe red pigment in blood that carries oxygen, and for the related protein myoglobin, in muscle. The increase \\nin lean body mass (LBM), composed mainly of muscle, is more important in adolescent boys than in girls. In \\npreadolescent years, LBM is about the same for both sexes. Once adolescence starts, however, the boy \\nundergoes a more rapid accumulation of LBM for ea ch additional kilogram of body weight gained during \\ngrowth, ending up with a final LBM maximum value double that of the girl. Other factors contributing to \\nelevated iron needs are increased body weight and the beginning of menstruation for girls. All these  factors \\nshould be taken into account when assessing iron needs in this group of age. \\n \\n \\nLearning Objectives: \\nAfter reading this unit, the students will be able to:  \\n1. Learn nutritional needs in children and adolescents. \\n2. Plan a balanced diet for children and adolescents.  \\n3. Plan a nutritious lunch box for children.  \\n4.

Iron from animal foods (known as haem iron) is much better absorbed than iron from non-\\nanimal sources (non-haem iron). Adolescents following vegetarian diets are therefore at an increased ri sk of \\niron-deficiency. However, vitamin C (e.g. from citrus fruits) and animal proteins (meat & fish) assist in the \\nabsorption of non-haem iron. \\nCalcium \\n \\nThe skeleton accounts for at least 99% of the body stores of calcium and the gain in skeletal weight i s most \\nrapid during the adolescent growth spurt. About 45% of the adult skeletal mass is formed during \\nadolescence, although its growth continues well beyond the adolescent period and into the third decade. All \\nthe calcium for the growth of the skeleton mu st be derived from the diet. The largest gains are made in early \\nadolescence, between about 10-14 years in girls and 12-16 years in boys. \\nDuring peak adolescent growth, calcium retention is, on average, about 200mg/day in girls and 300 mg/day \\nin boys. The efficiency of calcium absorption is only around 30% so it is important that the diet supplies an \\nadequate calcium intake to help build the densest bones possible. The achievement of peak bone mass during \\nchildhood and adolescence is crucial to reduce the r isk of osteoporosis in later years. By eating several \\nservings of dairy products, such as milk, curd and cheese, the recommended calcium intake can be achieved. \\nAs well as a good dietary supply of calcium, other vitamins or minerals, like vitamin D and phosphorous, are \\nneeded for building up bones. Physical activity is also essential, particularly weight-bearing exercise, which \\nprovides the stimulus to build and retain bone in the body. Activities such as cycling, gymnastics, skating, \\nball games, dancing and supervised weight training for at least 30-60 minutes a day, three to five times a \\nweek can help build bone mass and density. Making the right dietary and lifestyle choices early in life will \\nhelp young people develop health-promoting behaviors that they can follow throughout life. \\n \\nImportance of breakfast \\nBreakfast is important particularly for a school child. It breaks the fast to the sleep hours and prepares a child for \\nproblem solving and memory spans in the learning period at school. Children who ski p breakfast do not make up \\nnutrient and energy deficits later in the day and tend to perform more poorly on tests of cognition than those who \\neat breakfast. It is not enough for children to have just a glass of milk. An ideal breakfast should have at least  3-5 \\nfoods from the basic five food groups.  \\n \\nPacked lunches - The packed lunch is a lunch that is packed in a Tiffin box to be eaten by the child while in \\nschool. Packed lunches have become a necessity for school going children. Taking lunch from home needs little \\nefforts, but helps in maintaining good health.

The \\nkeys to healthy eating are: \\n \\n• Enjoy the wide variety of foods \\nWe need more than 40 different nutrients for good health and no single food can supply them \\nall. That\\'s why consumption of a wide variety of foods (including fruits, vegetables, cereals and \\ngrains, meats, fish and poultry, dairy products and fats and oils) , is necessary for good health \\nand any food can be enjoyed as part of a healthy diet.  \\n \\n• Eat regularly \\nScheduling eating times also ensures that meals are not missed, resulting in missed nutrients that \\nare often not compensated for by subsequent meals.  \\n \\n• Balance and moderation \\nBalancing your food intake means getting enough, but not too much, of each type of nutrient. If \\nportion sizes are kept reasonable, there is no need to eliminate favourite foods. There are no \\n\"good\" or \"bad\" foods, only good or bad diet s. Any food can fit into a healthy lifestyle by \\nremembering moderation and balance. \\n \\n• Maintain a healthy body weight and feel good \\nA healthy weight varies between individuals and depends on many factors including gender, \\nheight, age and heredity. Excess body fat results when more calories are eaten than are needed. \\nThose extra calories can come from any source - protein, fat, carbohydrate or alcohol - but fat is \\nthe most concentrated source of calories. Physical activity is a good way of increasing the \\nenergy (calories) expended and it can also lead to feelings of well-being.  \\n \\n• Don\\'t forget fruits and vegetables \\nAn increased intake of fruits and vegetables ensures daily intake of vital nutrients and the \\nmajority are naturally low in fat and calories. Nutritio nists are paying much more attention to \\nfruits and vegetables as \"packages\" of nutrients and other constituents that are healthful for \\nhumans. The \"antioxidant hypothesis\" has drawn attention to the role of micronutrients found in \\nfruits and vegetables lik e vitamins C and E , as well as a number of other natural protective \\nsubstances. The carotenes (beta-carotene, lutein and lycopene), the flavonoids (phenolic \\ncompounds that are widespread in commonly consumed fruits and vegetables such as apples \\nand onions  and beverages derived from plants like tea, cocoa and red wine) and the \\nphytoestrogens (principally isoflavones and lignans), are being demonstrated to have beneficial \\nroles in human health.’ \\n \\n• Fats in moderation \\nStudy Material'),\n",

It’s divided into \\nthree trimesters. Each trimester lasts between 12 and 14 weeks, or about three months. \\nEach trimester comes with its own specific hormonal and physiological changes. Being aware of \\nthe ways that growing baby is affecting a women’s body will assist to better prepare for these \\nchanges as they happen.  \\nThe first trimester lasts from the first through the 13th week of pregnancy. Although a women may \\nnot look pregnant during the first trimester, but the body i s going through massive changes as it \\naccommodates a growing baby. \\nIn the first few weeks following conception, hormone levels change significantly. The uterus \\nbegins to support the growth of the placenta and the fetus, the body adds to its blood supply to  \\ncarry oxygen and nutrients to the developing baby, and the heart rate increases.  \\nThe first trimester is vital for the development of baby .The baby will develop all of its organs by \\nthe end of the third month, so this is a crucial time. It’s important to maintain a healthy diet\\n.  \\nThe second trimester  (weeks 13 -27) is the most comfortable period of time for the majority of \\npregnant women. Most of the early pregnancy symptoms will gradually disappear.  \\nAn abdomen will start to look pregnant, as the uterus will grow rapidly in size. While the \\ndiscomforts of early pregnancy should ease off, there are  a few new symptoms to get used to. \\nCommon complaints include  leg cramps and heartburn. Women might feel more hungary and her \\nweight will increase and backache may become evident. \\nThe third trimester lasts from the 28th week through to the birth of your baby.  \\nDuring the third and final trimester of pregnancy, a baby’s  eyes, bones, organs, brain and lungs are \\ndeveloping and the nutritional needs are increasing. In addition to a baby’s rapid growth, a \\nwomen’s body is preparing to give birth. A healthy diet, packed with nutritious foods, is just as \\nimportant now as it was during the first two trimesters of pregnancy.         \\nA balanced diet is important in promoting the growth and development of the fetus and \\nsafeguarding the health of the mother.

In the long term \\nchronic malnutrition during pregnancy and early childhood manifest as stunted growth (low \\nheight for age) and wasting (low weight for height). Children who are malnourished in the early \\nyears of life fail to grow and develop to their full potential, both physically and mentally. The \\nconsequences of stunting extend to adulthood increasing the risk of poor pregnancy outcome (i.e. \\nthe newborn is of low birth weight), impaired cognition that results in poor school performance, \\nreduced economic productivity and earning.

Biochemical Assessment \\nBiochemical assessment i.e. laboratory tests based on blood and urine can be important indicators \\nof nutritional status. Biochemical assessment deals with measuring the level of essential dietary \\nconstituents (i.e. nutrient concentration, metabolites) in the body fluids (normally blood and urine) \\nwhich is helpful in evaluating the possibility of malnutrition. For example, Anemia is the most \\nwidespread of all the nutritional deficiencies found among individuals in our country. It is  \\nlargely due to iron deficiency. So the measure of the haemoglobin (Hb) in the blood is helpful in \\nevaluating the possibility of iron deficiency. Similarly a measure of the level of iodine in the \\nurine reflects the iodine status in a community. Also stool examination for the presence of ova \\nand/or intestinal parasites gives useful information. \\nThe advantages of using biochemical assessment are that it is useful in detecting early changes in \\nbody metabolism or nutritional status much before the appearance of overt clinical signs and \\nsymptoms. It is precise and accurate. But it can be time consuming and expensive. It requires \\ntrained personnel and facilities. \\n \\nD. Dietary Assessment \\nFrom our study so far it must be clear that diet or food intake is a major life -style factor which \\ninfluences our nutritional status. Dietary assessment, therefore involves reviewing the intake of \\nfood and the nutrients and comparing the amount consumed with reference value to see whether \\ndeficiency or excess is likely. So when a systematic inquiry into the food supplies and food \\nconsumption of individuals and population groups is made, we call it a diet survey. \\nDiet surveys can be undertaken at an individual and/or family/household level. Dietary intake \\ncan be assessed by subjective self report such as food recall, diaries or food frequency \\nquestionnaires. Primarily, there are a wide range of methods used in diet surveys.

It is called an \"essential trace element\" because \\nvery small amounts of zinc are necessary for human health. Since the \\nhuman body does not store excess zinc, it must be consumed \\nregularly as part of the diet. Zinc performs many factions as a part \\nof every cell in the body and so zinc is essential for normal growth, \\ndevelopment, reproduction, and immunity. Zinc  is present in all \\ncells, tissues, organs fluids and secretion although about 90% \\nbody’s zinc is in muscles and bone. \\n      Prevalence- In India mild to moderate deficiency of zinc may be \\nwidely prevalent due to cereal pulse based diets, low in zinc and \\nhigh in phytates that may cause zinc deficiency.  Phytate, or phytic \\nacid, is a naturally occurring compou nd found in all plant foods \\nlike beans, grains, nuts, and  seeds. The chief concern about \\nphytates is that they can bind to certain dietary minerals including \\niron, zinc, manganese and, to a lesser extent calcium, and slow \\ntheir absorption. Phytates in your eve ryday meals should not be an \\nissue for you as long as you’re eating a balanced diet.

Growth Monitoring and nutrition \\nsurveillance are two important activities that are undertaken. Weight-for-age growth cards are \\nmaintained for all children below six years. This helps to detect growth faltering and helps in \\nassessing nutritional status.  Besides, severely malnourished children are given special \\nsupplementary feeding and referred to medical services.  \\n2. IMMUNIZATION: \\nImmunization of pregnant women and infants protects children from six vaccine preventable \\ndiseases-poliomyelitis, diphtheri a, pertussis, tetanus, tuberculosis and measles.

NON-FORMAL PRE-SCHOOL EDUCATION (PSE) \\nThe Non- formal Pre -school Education (PSE) c omponent of the ICDS is  considered the \\nbackbone of the ICDS programme, since all its services essentially converge at the anganwadi \\n– a village/s lum/colony/urban slum courtyard. Anganwadi Centre (AWC) is the main \\nplatform for delivering of these services. These AWCs have been set up in every village \\nslum/colony/urban slum in the country. It  is also the most joyful play- way daily activity, \\nvisibly sustained for three hours a day. It brings and keeps young children at the anganwadi \\ncentre - an activity that motivates parents and communities. PSE,  as envisaged in the ICDS, \\nfocuses on total development of the child, in the age up to six years, mainly from the \\nunderprivileged groups. The early learning component of the ICDS is a significant input for \\nproviding a sound foundation for cumulative lifelong learning and development. It also \\ncontributes to the universalization of primary education, by providing to the child the \\nnecessary preparation for primary schooling and offering substitute care to younger siblings, \\nthus freeing the older ones – especially girls – to attend school. The Non formal pre school \\neducation is provided to the children in the age group of 3 to 6 yrs on all working days of the \\nanganwadi centres. The Preschool educ ation is provided to the beneficiaries according to the \\nTime Table prepared for them. Pre School Kits are available in each anganwadi centres. \\n6. NUTRITION AND HEALTH EDUCATION:  \\nNutrition, Health and Education (NHED) is a key element of the work of the anganwadi \\nworker. This forms part of BCC (Behaviour Change Communication) strategy. This has the \\nlong term goal of capacity- building of women – especially in the age group of 15- 45 years – \\nso that they can look after their own health, nutrition and development needs as well as that of \\ntheir children and families. \\nLadies in the age group of 15 to 45 yrs are covered for providing Nutrition and Health \\nEducation.

It is also the period to shape and consolidate healthy eating and life \\nstyle behaviors, thereby preventing the  onset of nutrition related chronic diseases i n womanhood \\nand prevalence of  malnutrition in future generation. Iron deficiency anaemia is the most \\nwidespread micronutrient deficiency affecting the vulnerable groups including adolescent girls  \\nwhich reduces the capacity to learn and work, resulting in l ower productivity and limiting \\neconomic and social development. Anaemia during pregnancy leads to high maternal and neonatal \\nmortality and low birth weight etc. Addressing the health needs of Adolescent Girls will not only \\nlead to a healthier and more prod uctive women force but will also help to break the \\nintergenerational cycle of malnutrition.

Thereafter, Nutrition Programme for Adolescent Girls (NPAG) was initiated as a  \\npilot project in the year 2002-03 in 51 identified districts across the country to address the problem \\nof under -nutrition amo ng adolescent girls. Under the  programme, 6 kg of free food grains per \\nbeneficiary per month are given to underweight adolescent girls. The above two schemes have \\ninfluenced the lives of AGs to some extent, but have  not shown the desired impact. Moreover, the \\nabove two schemes had limited  financial assistance and coverage besides having similar \\ninterventions and catered to more or less the same target groups. A need has therefore, emerged to \\nformulate a new comprehensive scheme with richer content, merging the erstwhile two  schemes \\nthat would address the multi -dimensional problems of AGs. This Scheme  shall be called Rajiv \\nGandhi Scheme for Empowerment of Adolescent Girls  (RGSEAG) --“SABLA”. It would replace \\nKSY and NPAG in the 200 selected districts.

Care during pregnancy and delivery: The focus of IGMSY is to improve  nutritional and \\nhealth status of pregnant and lactating women across the country  by partly compensating for \\ntheir wage loss and encouraging increased access to  supplementary nutrition under ICDS \\nScheme. \\na) Early Identification and Registration of pregnancy:  Early registration of  pregnancy is \\nessential for availing facilities offered by the health care  services to assess the health and \\nnutritional status of the pregnant woman. It  also helps to screen for complications early in the \\npregnancy. Early identification and registration of pregnancy is being promoted by the  \\nGovernment of India primarily through National Rural Health Mission(NRHM) and Janani \\nSuraksha Yojana (JSY). \\nb) Antenatal Care (ANC): During the ANC at the health centre, vital  milestones of \\npregnancy are noted. Ideally, apart from the ANC at  registration, three ANCs are necessary \\nand are mandated under NRHM.Periodic antenatal check -ups help in early detection, \\nmanagement of complications, timely advice and appropriate referral. This can help improve \\nmaternal and neonatal survival. ANC is a key entry point for a pregnant woman to receive a \\nbroad range of health promotion and preventive health services, including nutritional support \\nand prevention and treatment anaemia and other infectious diseases associated with \\nreproductive health \\nc) Institutional Delivery: One of the accepted strategies for reducing maternal mortality is to \\npromote deliveries at health institutions by skilled personnel  like doctors and nurses. The \\nJanani Suraksha Yojana (JSY ) provides  cash assistance for Institutional Delivery. The \\nbenefits under JSY  are linked to pregnant women getting the delivery conducted in health \\ncentres/ hospitals.

Immunization of pregnant women against tetanus also reduces maternal \\nand neonatal  mortality.

Besides increasing the birth weight, \\ntimely intervention will help reduce both Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and Maternal Mortality \\nRate (MMR). It is to ensure that malnutrition doesn’t affect children’s cognitive development \\nor physical growth. The initiative seeks to reduce the level of stunting, undernutrition and low \\nbirth weight by 2% each, and  anaemia by 3%. It aims to reduce stunting f rom 38.4% (NFHS-\\n4) to 25% by 2022.

What are these terms? Let's define them.  \\nNutrition Education (NE): Nutrition education is a process of persuading people to act in their \\nown best interest for attaining nutritional well -being. It is a process by which beliefs, attitudes, \\nenvironmental influences and understanding about food leads to practices that are sound, \\npractical and consistent with individual needs that will make a maximum contribution to \\nhealth and social well being. \\nInformation, Education and Communication (IEC): IEC is described as a strategy to inform the \\npublic about nutrition/health concerns and attempts to change or reinforce a set of behaviour \\nin a target population regarding the specific problem in a predefined period of  time. \\nBehaviour Change Communication (BCC): BCC is a process of working with individuals, \\nfamilies, communities through different communication methods to promote positive health \\nbehaviour and support  an environment that enables the community to maintain and sustain \\npositive health behaviour. \\nNow that you have gone through the three definitions what do you notice? Yes, BCC, IEC \\nand nutrition education terminologies, all three, are in fact, interchangeable. They all aim at \\ncreating awareness,  motivating people to change behaviors and result in necessary action \\ni.e. persuades people to adopt and sustain desirable nutrition and health practices. \\nDisseminating knowledge provides important information; however, provision of information \\non its own has little effect. Act ion directed at strengthening the skills and capabilities of \\nindividuals to make healthy behaviour choices and change nutrition/health behaviour should \\nbe the objective of any nutrition education communication exercise.

If you look at the figure carefully you would \\nidentify four components in communication process. These include -  SENDER, RECEIVER, \\nMESSAGE and the FEEDBACK. \\n \\nFigure 1: The communication process \\n \\nLet us review these four components in the context of behaviour change communication: \\n \\n1. The BCC process begins with the conceptualization of an idea by the SOURCE.  In  this \\nprocess the sender or communicator comm unicates the message. The communicator \\ncan be any source, you or any other nutrition/health expert or health worker or it can be \\nany medium/channel such as audio visual aid like the television, radio etc. \\n2. The second component is the Message. Message consists of what is actually \\ncommunicated. Message can be oral, written, non verbal such as body gesture, sound \\netc. or picture or any other signal that we use to get our idea across for motivation or \\nbehavior change. An example of a written message in nutri tion education communication \\ncould be: \"Breast milk is the best food for the Infant\". Remember, the message should be \\nbrief, logical, persuasive, coherent i.e. clearly address the problem/issue to be dealt with. \\n3. The third component is the RECEIVER. Rec eiver is the person/population (audience) for \\nwhom the message is intended or targeted. It can be an individual or a vulnerable group \\nor a community as a whole with whom we communicate  for  change  in  behavior. For \\nexample in an infant and child feeding nutrition communication programme the primary \\naudience could be the  mothers,  grandmothers  or  older siblings whoever is the \\ncaretakers of children, who need to be informed. \\nStudy Material'),\n",

The last component is FEEDBACK. Feedback is defined as the response or \\ninformation provided as a result of an event, the event in this case being the \\ntransmission of information. Feedback occurs when the receiver receives the message \\nfrom a source. The receiver listens, reads or observes non verbal signals or visual \\ninformation and send non verbal or verbal feedback to the source who can than \\nmodify the message in response to the feedback to make it more persuasive to the \\nreceiver. So you may have noticed that feedback is a two way process.\\n \\n \\n \\nIt would be worth remembering here that behavior change communication process will be \\neffective only and only if all the four components highlighted above are present. \\n \\nIn order to facilitate the process of communication we  need  communication  skills.  These skills \\nare gained through knowledge and practice of the methods of communication. The messages can \\nbe conveyed through a variety  of  communication  methods.  These  are  described in the next  \\nsection. \\nInformation, education and communication (IEC) approaches are used to reach the target \\naudience. There are a wide variety of methods/media that can be  used  to  disseminate \\nmessages, information to the people. The correct choice of method is an essential aspect of \\ncommunication in nutrition and health education. Off course which method  to  use  will  depend \\non who the target audience is i.e. are we reaching out to rural population or urban population or to \\nschool children or to general public? Each audience has their own charact eristics (i.e. age, \\nexperiences, education level, exposure to media, reading, writing, listening skills, ownership of \\nradio/TV etc.). Also the cost factor will influence the use of \\nmethod/media. \\nPrimarily the behaviour change communication methods can be categorized as: \\n\\uf0b7 Interpersonal Communication methods: include all those forms of communication involving \\ndirect interaction between the source and the receiver. Examples of interpersonal \\ncommunication methods  include:  interviews,  individual  discussions, face to face \\ncounseling or group discussions, community meetings, events etc. \\n\\uf0b7 Mass communication media: Mass communication comprises techniques by which \\nspecialized groups employ technological devices such as press, radio, television audio \\nvisuals aids like films, documentaries etc. to disseminate content, information to large \\nStudy Material'),\n",

In this method the Source and the Receiver  are  never  in \\ndirect contact. The interaction between source and receiver is mediated \\nthrough the visual image (poster, flip chart, video, TV etc.), print (news \\npaper, magazines), verbal (radio, etc.) or by a combination of these \\nelements. Mass media can be very effective in creating awareness and \\ninterest in new ideas among general population.

Our mind and body are made of the food \\nwe eat and it continues until we live. The body parts, organs, muscles, blood and bones are all made from the food we have \\neaten. Food gives energy and stamina for work. It also gives emotional stability and security. Our appearance and feeling of \\ngood health and happiness also depends on the right kind  of food and the quantity of food that we eat. Lot of research is \\nbeing done and new findings published every day to  increase our knowledge about food and nutrition, and to find ways to \\napply this knowledge in choosing the right foods to eat, so that our body is well nourished and healthy. \\n1.2   DEFINITION OF FOOD, NUTRITION, NUTRIENTS and DIET \\nFood is the very basis of our life . It contains different nutrients that are needed by the body for survival and sustenance. \\nThe food we eat  is digested and converted into nutrients. These nutrients are absorbed and transported to different parts \\nof the body, and utilized for the day -to-day functioning. A t the end they are disposed of by further metabolism and \\ntransformed into the end products. We need to consume a variety of foods in order to remain healthy. \\nThus, we can define food as any solid or liquid which when eaten can supply any of the following: \\n\\uf0b7 Material from which the body can produce movement, heat or other forms of energy, \\n\\uf0b7 Material for growth, repair and reproduction, \\n\\uf0b7 Substances necessary to regulate the production of energy or the processes of growth and repair.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"2 \\n \\nThe components of foods which have these functions are called nutrients. In other words nutrients are vital in keeping a \\nliving thing alive and helping it to grow. \\nThe diet consists of those foods or mixtures of foods in the amounts which are eaten daily. A good diet provides adequate \\namounts of all the nutrients, without harmful excesses, from a wide range of foods.  Dietary habits are dependent on \\ngeographical and cultural traits and vary accordingly. \\nNutrition is the process by which living things receive the food necessary for them to be healthy. The science of nutrition is \\na study of all the processes of growth, maintenance and repair of the living body which depend upon the digestion and \\nabsorption of food and the study of that food. \\nA nutritionist is an expert on the relationship between food and health and a  dietitian is an expert on what one should eat \\nunder different conditions. \\n1.3 FUNCTIONS OF FOOD \\nLet us now get acquainted with the major functions of food. As we know we eat when we are hungry, but foo d not only \\nremoves hunger, it also gives us a feeling of satisfaction and renewed strength.  We also share food to express happiness, \\nfriendship, love and unity. Most families bond over mealtimes. Most meetings and important discussio ns in companies \\nhappen over lunches and dinners. Thus, food has many important functions in our lives. When we understand t hese \\nfunctions, we appreciate how they affect our food intake and our physical and mental well-being. \\n1.3.1  Physiological functions \\n The most important function of food is to build our body. We have seen that we probably weighed somewhere between 2.5 \\nto 3.2 kg at birth and now weigh between 45 to 60 kg. This growth is the  result of the food we ate from birth to adulthood. \\nNow as an adult, our weight is constant which shows that we have achieved optimum growth. At this stage, the food we eat \\nhelps to maintain and renew worn out cells of our body and keep the body in good condition. \\nSecondly, food provides the energy, our body needs for all its activities, voluntary and involuntary . We know that even \\nwhen we sleep, many of our body's activities continue, like breathing, heartbeat, digestion, absorption of food, etc. These \\nkeep us alive without any effort on our part and are called involuntary activities. \\nThe work or activities we do when we are awake and our mind is in it like studying, walking, cooking or working at the desk, \\nor playing a game of badminton, is called voluntary activity. The amount of energy  we need for all these depends on the \\nkind of activity and the time and energy we spend doing it. \\nThe third function of foo d is to regulate all the activities of the body and protect it  from diseases and infections. Examples \\nof some of the activities which regulate the body are given below: \\n\\uf0b7 Beating of our heart for circulation of blood  \\n\\uf0b7 Maintenance of our body temperature \\n\\uf0b7 Muscle contraction for voluntary and involuntary movements \\n\\uf0b7 Removal of waste from the body in form of sweat, urine and feces, etc. \\nApart from these , vital nutrients in food also help  to protect the body  from various infections , diseases and from \\nwearing out. \\n  1.3.2  Psychological functions \\nIn addition, to meeting our physical needs, food also satisfies certain emotional needs. These include a feeling of security, \\nlove and attention. We feel secure when familiar foods are served  which are also known as comfort f oods. When a child \\ncomes home from school the mother knows that he/ she is hungry and serves food. Thus, she expresses her  love and \\nattention. Many times, we miss our mother because of the attachment to her cooking.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='3 \\n \\nWhen we share our lunch with a colleague , we express acceptance and  friendship. If we are amongst friends, we try \\nunfamiliar foods and enlarge our food experience. These are some of the positive aspects of food  acceptance. There are \\noccasions when we are hungry, but are unable to eat even a nutritious  meal, because the foods are unfamiliar or we are \\nunhappy or lonely. We need to understand these aspects about food acceptance, so that when we plan meals, we will not \\nonly think of nutrition, but also the persons for whom we plan. \\n1.3.3  Socio-cultural Functions \\nWe know how important food is in our social and cultural life. We serve refreshments at meetings and seminars or to \\nvisitors to create a relaxed atmosphere  for an exchange of ideas. In most of our  festivals and celebrations we have lunch \\nand dinner with family and friends which binds us together. Food is also used as an expression of happiness. For example, \\nwe distribute sweets when we pass examinations, buy a car or when there is a marriage feast. We also celebrate birthdays, \\nanniversaries, promotions etc. by cutting cakes and enjoying food at parties. In religious functions like Easter, Ramzan, Rajo, \\nNuakhai, etc. we make special preparations to distribute food offerings . Thus , food helps to strengthen our social and \\ncultural ties.  \\n1.3.4 Food Habits \\nFood intake is related to food habits, which is a powerful force in deciding what we eat. We tend to eat according to our set \\nfood habits and like all habits these may be good or bad. For mation of food habits have to be understood so that we can \\ntake appropriate measures towards building good food habits. \\n\\uf0b7 Regional and Community Variations: Food habits are affected by food production and supply. For example, rice is the \\nstaple food in the East, West and South of India  whereas wheat is popular  in the North.  This is because of agricultural \\npractices of the region. Then the amounts and kinds of foods we eat depend on  the money that one can spend.  The \\ngeographic region, religion, community and family beliefs and practices that have developed over several generations, \\nheavily influences a family’s eating pattern. \\nInspite of all th ese variations, all regional patterns can meet the nutritional needs of people if sufficient food from each \\ngroup is i ncluded. A particular food chosen and the way it is prepared and seasoned is a matter of personal ch oice. Social \\ncustoms like when and with whom and what to eat, will affect our exposure and hence our acceptance pattern. \\n\\uf0b7 Personal Factors: The atmosphere in  which we eat may modify our attitude towards food . A happy or an unhappy \\natmosphere affects our reactions to food and eating. Everyone has a personal response to the taste of foods. We may like \\npungent foods or acid foods while our friends may prefer mild  or astringent foods. These basic influences affect our food \\nhabits, as we tend to adopt the food practices of our family. Our selection of foods should be based on the knowledge of \\nfood values. Convenience of food preparation also affects food habits of the present generation. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Other Factors : Many other influences modify our food habits. When we move away from our region for education or work, \\nwe are exposed to new foods and our eating pattern is modified. Travelling within our food region and outside also \\ninfluences our food habits. Media also has a large role to play in food choices today. Though food habits are affec ted by \\nmany influences, individual food intake is dependent on personal preferences that are an important factor in deciding our \\nnutritional status. \\nThe best time to develop good and healthy food habits is in childhood. As f ood habits are closely associated with sense of \\nsecurity, so any modification, particularly in the adult stage, will require a strong motivation.  \\nWe know that energy need decreases with age hence modification in food habits need to be made to reduce energy in take \\nas people grow  older. When we see old people who are overweight,  we can see  that they have not made the  required \\nadjustment. We also s ee many  people, who are not overweight, but eat foods  that do not meet their need for other \\nnutrients, except calories. It is difficult for such  people to see the need for change because they maintain their weight and \\ndo not associate any symptoms of poor health they may have due to their eating habits. Generally, cause and effect are not \\neasily noted.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"4 \\n \\nOne must be cautious while approaching people to modify their food habits. We will need to understand the background of \\ntheir food habits before we can help them to improve or change their diet. The desire for good health is universal. It can be \\nused as a motivating force to help others. \\n1.3.5 Food misinformation \\nWe spend a considerable part of our time and income to select and purchase foods. Besides food habits, our choices are \\nalso affected by prevalent misconceptions, we have about foods and food products. We are exposed to a variety of views \\nabout the foods and their nutritional  contribution--through conversation, and through newspapers, magazines and books.  \\nPeople see and hear advertisements about foods and drinks. So their ideas about food are indirectly modified by what they \\nhear and see. The internet, television and other multimedia sources also influence food habits to a great extent. \\nWater: Some people think drinking water can help them lose weight  but water cannot wash away the fat from the cells, or \\nthose extra calories we get from overeating. If we drink water instead of the calorie-rich soft drinks, we might cut down on \\nour calorie intake. When a person or a child suffers from diarrhea and vomiting, some people restrict their water intake \\nwith the hope of stopping it, which is very wrong. W e know it is very important to feed clean, boile d, cooled water, with \\nadded sugar, salt and lemon, to a person who has suffered loss of body fluids due to diarrhea or vom iting. Water intake in \\nsuch a condition is crucial to prevent dehydration especially in children. \\nCereal and cereal products: There is a wrong notion that starchy foods, such as rice and bread, are high in calories. Many \\ndieters frequently reduce or cut out cereals from their diet. We need to remind them that basic cere als and plain breads \\n(like chapatti) are not very high in calories. T he calories come from the foods they add such as ghee, butter, cheese, jam, \\nsugar, oil, chutney, etc. It is the extra calorie foods that they should omit, not the breads and cereals.  \\nAnother misconception is that weight reduction is possible if we eat bread or chapati instead of rice. Actually, both rice and \\nwheat contain about the same number of calories. It is the total calorie intake that needs to be red uced not calories from a \\nparticular food.  \\nWe have noticed that many people cut the sugar fro m tea or coffee to reduce their calorie intake but do not skip the \\nbiscuits, cake, or other snacks that are served with the tea or coffee. The teaspoon of sugar they skip is only 20calories, and \\nthe snacks they eat may add 50- 100 'calories. So they end up having 2 to 5 times the calories than sugar. \\nFats and oils: All vegetable oils (except coconut and olive oil) contain a high amount of PUFA (poly unsaturated fatty acids). \\nIt is important to understand that vegetable oils do not contain any cholesterol. T o say that a particular brand of vegetable \\noil contains no cholesterol is intended to misguide us to think that other brands of vegetable oils contain cholesterol. The \\nnature of the oil of fat (unsaturated or saturated, fatty acid content, cholesterol cont ent, etc.) is not to be confused with \\ntheir calorie value. We know that  all oils, ghee and vanaspati provide the same calories i.e. nine calories per gram. \\nTherefore, we realize that when there is an advertisement of oil that contains less or low calories, we must know that it is \\nnot true. \\nOther foods and food products : Weaning food products are advertised as 'Doctors recommend' or 'more nourishing food \\nfor growth'. The fact is that there is nothing special about these pr oducts. Most of these are made from the cereals we use \\nat home, to which they add some milk powder, sugar, minerals and vitamins.  \\nSome brand of biscuits claim they are the best food for children. Actually , most biscuits are made from maida (refined \\nwheat flour), with the addition of varying amounts of fat and sugar. Thus, biscuits have lot of calories. When we feed \\nchildren with these instead of a meal, it does not provide the child with all the nutrients it needs. \\nAnother group of products advocated is a variety of synthetic drinks and carbonated beverages.  These contain only sugar, \\nflavor, color and acid and provide only energy. A few may have a little vitamin C, and nothing else. When these are taken \\nwith fast food and junk food they create health hazard s in the long run. Instead, if we make traditional cool drinks at home \\nand other snacks and food items it will cost a fraction of the price we pay for commercial weaning foods and c hildren’s \\nsnacks and drinks. Another advantage would be that children would develop healthy food habits in this way, which will help \\nthem through the lifetime.\"),\n",

For that \\nfirst, we need to review the nutritional components of the foods that we eat. The following paragraph will focus on this \\naspect. \\n 1.4.1 Classification of nutrients \\nAll foods are classified into three broad categories:- \\n\\uf0b7 Energy yielding foods (Carbohydrates and Fats) \\n\\uf0b7 Body building foods (proteins) \\n\\uf0b7 Protective  and  regulatory foods (vitamins, minerals and other foods) \\n1.4.2 Types of nutrients \\nThe foods that we consume are composed of varying quantities of the following nutritionally important components: \\n1)  Carbohydrates \\n2)  Proteins \\n3)  Lipids \\n4)  Water \\n5)  Minerals \\n6)  Vitamins \\n7)  Fibre \\n8)  Phytochemicals and anti-oxidants \\n9)  Detoxifying agents \\nIf these nutritional components are consumed daily in the amounts and proportion required, then the chances are that we \\nwill maintain a good health. \\n1.4.3 Functions of nutrients \\nWe use foods such as wheat, rice, dal, vegetables, fruits, milk, eggs, fish, meat, sugar, oils, on a daily basis in our diet. These \\nfoods are made up of the nutrients mentioned earlier. Let us get to know the functions of these nutrients in our body.  \\nCarbohydrates: We get about 70-80 per cent of our energy from carbohydrates. The energy content of foods is expressed \\nin calories. One gram of carbohydrate provides four calories. If we take these in excess of our body 's need, the unused part \\nis stored as glycogen in the muscle or converted to fat and stored for later use. The main carbohydr ates in our diet are \\nstarches found in cereals, dals and tubers, sugar from sugarcane and fruits. Cereals and dals also p rovide a large part of the \\nproteins, some minerals and vitamins. \\nProteins: As we know, proteins are present in all living tissues -both plant and animal. Next to water, protein is the most \\nabundant component of our body. About one-sixth our body weight is protein. The mai n function of protein is building of \\nnew tissues, and maintenance and repair of those already built. Further, a number of regulatory and protective substances \\n(enzymes, antibodies, hormones) in the body are made from proteins.  \\nWe get about 8 to 15 per cen t of our total energy from proteins. Energy supply is thus a secondary function of our dietary \\nproteins. Each gram of protein gives four calories of energy to our body. Protein is present in vege tables and animal \\nsources. Among the former, pulses, nuts and soybeans are good sources of protein. Among the latter, milk, fish, egg, meat, \\nchicken and liver are rich sources. Paneer and khoa (condensed milk) are also good sources of protein. \\nFats: In India, about 10 to 30 per cent of the energy needs are met from oils and fats. One gram of oil or fat gives nine \\ncalories of energy to the body. Please remember that the fats and oils are concentrated sources of e nergy. We need fats as \\na medium for the absorption of fat- soluble vitamins. We need essential fatty acids, which vegetable oils provide. The oil we \\nuse in seasoning, the ghee or butter used as a spread, and the fat in eggs and meat, are the major s ources of fats in our\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"6 \\n \\ndiet. The oilseeds and nuts we use in food preparations also contribute some fat. Remember i f we take more energy than \\nour body needs, in any form, be it fats, carbohydrates 'or proteins, it is stored in our body as fat. \\nMinerals: Our bones and teeth need minerals for their formation and maintenance. Iron is needed for formation of the red \\npigment in the blood. Minerals have an important role in the regulation of a number of body processe s, e.g. muscle \\ncontraction, nerve stimulation, respiration, etc. we get the minerals that we need from a variety of  foods. For example, we \\nget calcium from milk and leafy vegetables, iron from leafy vegetables, dals and eggs, sodium from salt and other foods. \\nVitamins: We need different vitamins, for example, vitamin A, B -complex, C, D, etc. Our body needs these to grow and \\ndevelop, to help our eyes, nerves a nd skin to remain healthy, and to protect us from infections. We need very small \\namounts of these vitamins. We get these from a variety of foods like leafy vegetables, carrots, amla , guava, masumbi, \\noranges, pulses, whole grain cereals and eggs. \\nWater: Our body contains approximately 60 to 65 per cent water. Hence, it is an essential part of our body structure. We \\nknow, water is a universal solvent. It carries food into the body, helps in the digestion and absorp tion of food and ensures \\nelimination of waste from the body. Water helps to regulate body temperature. It acts as a lubricant in the mobile parts of \\nour body, such as joints and prevents friction. We need about 5 to 6 glasses of water each day. We get it from the water we \\ndrink and beverages such as tea, coffee, etc. \\n1.4.4 Assimilation of food in the body \\nWe learnt about all the nutrients that the body needs. What we eat becomes flesh and blood. The process by which the  \\nnature of food is changed in the body is called digestion. The digestive tract is nature's (or our body's) ingenious way of \\nextracting nutrients from the food we eat. The digestive tract is selective. It breaks down th e materials that are nutritious \\nfor the body into particles that we can assimilate. Those particles that are left undigested pass out  from the other end of \\nthe digestive tract.  \\nOur body needs energy to perform its various activities, protein to replace the cells it has lost and to grow, various vitamins \\nand minerals for bone and blood formation and for the body to work efficiently and smoothly. \\nThe digestive system: \\nWhen the body requires food, it signals us to eat. This signal is hunger. The moment we eat something the digestive journey \\nstarts. As we swallow, the food slides across the gullet  or esophagus passing over the entrance to our lungs. Whenever we \\nswallow, the body automatically closes off all air passages, so that we do not choke. When we chew food, we break it up \\n(grind it) into small particles with our teeth.  \\nFrom the mouth, the food goes into the stomach, where it stay s for a few hours. The stomach  breaks the food into still \\nsmaller particles, mixing it at the same time with acid and  the enzyme pepsin, which chemically alters the protein in the \\nfood. From the stomach, the food enters the intestines. \\n We have a small intestine and a large  intestine. The small intestine is actually not small at all. It is actually a 20 feet coiled \\ntube within the abdomen. From here, food enters the large intestine. In the colon (latter portion of the large intestine), the \\nbody withdraws water, leaving behind semi -solid waste. The waste is held back here  because of the strong muscles ( called \\nsphincter muscles) of the rectum. It would be inconvenient and embarrassing if one had to excrete continuously. When the \\nbody chooses to defecate, this muscle is relaxed and the waste material is voided. \\nThe path that food follows in the body is like this: \\nMouth (epiglottis)\\uf0e0 Gullet (esophagus) \\uf0e0 Stomach\\uf0e0 Small intestine \\uf0e0 Large intestine \\uf0e0Rectum (anus). \\n\\uf0b7 For food to pass smoothly through the system, it must be mixed with water. If we drink too little water, the food \\nbecomes compact and moves very slowly. \\n\\uf0b7  For digestive enzymes to work on food, it should be finely divided and suspended in water so that every particle is \\naccessible to the enzymes. Once digestion is  complete and all the essential nutrients are absorbed, the  residue \\nwhich remains is excreted. It would be wasteful and inconvenient to excrete large amounts of water  with this\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='7 \\n \\nresidue. So your body withdraws some water, leaving a semi-solid mass just smooth enough and easy to pass. This \\nshows that food is altered physically in the digestive tract. \\n\\uf0b7 The enzymes of the digestive tract break down or digest carbohydrates, protein and fat into smaller units. This is \\nchemical alteration of food. \\nThe body needs many nutrients, which it absorbs from food through the digestive  tract. The digestive tract dige sts only \\ncarbohydrates, fats and proteins although  the food we eat contains many other  substances like vitamins, minerals,  \\npreservatives, colors, etc. \\nCertain glands in the body contribute the digestive juices or enzymes .These are the salivary glands, gastric glands, the liver \\nand the pancreas. The enzymes from these glands break down proteins, fats and carbohydrates. \\nPhysical Alteration of Food: we chew or masticate food, and grind it. Chewing food helps to \\n(i) Increase the surface area of food,  \\n(ii) Break the cell walls of cells, releasing the nutrients.  \\nIn the mouth, the tongue helps to mix the food with saliva. In the  stomach, food is mixed and altered further by \\ncontraction and relaxation of stomach  muscles (known as peristalsis). Fat, we know, does not mix with water  but \\ncontraction and relaxation of the stomach muscles breaks up the fat into small  particles and disperses it in the watery \\nmedium or liquid in the stomach. This dispersion of fat in the liquid is called emulsification. \\nRefer to figure 1.4.4a for the digestive system \\n Digestion of food: \\nCarbohydrates, fats and proteins that are in the food are much too large to be of use to  the body. Before the body can use \\nthem, it has to break them down into units, which are small enough to be absorbed into the bloodstream. \\nOne of the commonest forms of carbohydrate in food is starch. Starch is made up of many small units called glucose. All \\ncarbohydrates must be broken down into small soluble units for utilization by the body. \\nDigestion of c arbohydrate starts when you begin chewing food. When we c hew some bread or  rice, we find it tastes \\nsweeter as we keep chewing. This is because saliva contains a starch-splitting enzyme called ptyalin mixes with the starch in \\nthe food . In the stomach, littl e break down of carbohydrate occurs. In the intestines, however, the  carbohydrate is \\ncompletely hydrolyzed to glucose.  \\nHydrolysis means break down of a large substance into smaller ones with the addition of water.  \\nJust like starch in the rice must be hydrolysed, so also the protein in the pulses. Protein digestion begins in the stomach due \\nto the action of the enzyme, pepsin. However, pepsin by itself does not complete the digestion. I n the small intestine, \\nprotein digestion is completed by other enzymes (proteases) which are secreted by the pancreas. \\nFat digestion occurs mainly in the small intestine. Bile from the gall bladder breaks the  fat into small particles. Thus, the \\nenzymes have more access to the fat to hydrolyze them. Fats are also hydrolyzed during digestion. Just like carbohydrate \\nand protein, digestion of fat takes place gradually, in stages. Digestion of any one carbohydrate, protein or fat is like starting \\nwith a large chain of beads and splitting this into pieces by removing one bead at a time. Not everything we eat needs to be \\ndigested, e.g., vitamins and minerals or simple sugars like glucose.  \\nHowever, many times, the minerals and vitamins are bound to the fat, protein or carbohydrate in your food. Thus for these \\nvitamins and minerals to be available for absorption, first they need to be separated from the complexes in which these are \\nfound in the food. Fat -soluble vitamins need to be dissolved in fat in order to be absorbed.  Before absorption, the other \\nnutrients are dissolved  in water. Therefore, water is essential for absorption of most nutrients.  Enzymes speed up \\nhydrolysis just like a mixer hastens the grinding of food into smaller units. For hydrolysis to occur, water is necessary..'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='8 \\n \\nAny food that has not been digested and absorbed f rom the small intestine goes into the  large intestine. Fibre is one \\nsubstance in our diet that remains undigested. Fibre is present in fruits, vegetables, in the outer skin of cereal grains and \\npulses. Fibre has  the property of absorbing water and swelling . It is not digested; it only increases the bulk (amount) of \\nundigested material. In addition, it soaks up water like a sponge. As a result, if we eat sufficient  fibre everyday, we can \\nensure that the muscles of our intestines are stimulated and defecation occurs regularly and constipation can be prevented. \\nIn the large intestine, no new enzymes are produced and therefore no further digestion  takes place. The main task of the \\nlarge intestine is to remove excess water from the  undigested material. Remember that most of the break down stages in \\ndigestion involve hydrolysis and therefore need wate r. A lot of water passes into the large intestine. After  this water is \\nremoved. The undigested material is removed from the body or excreted through the anus. \\nAbsorption of nutrients: \\nAbsorption is the process by which the products of digestion pass out of the digestive tract  through the cells in the \\nintestinal wall, into the bloodstream. \\nMost nutrients are absorbed directly into our blood, which is then distributed to different parts of the body. Some nutrients \\nare absorbed in the stomach, for  example vitamin B 12. Minerals like calcium and iron are absorbed in the first  portion of \\nthe small intestine. Most end products of digestion of carbohydrates, fats and proteins are absorbed in the small intestine. \\nAbsorption of carbohydrates, fats and proteins takes place after they are hydrolyzed into their smallest units: Glucose, fatty \\nacids, and amino acids, respectively. \\nUtilization of nutrients: \\nAfter being absorbed in the s mall intestine, the smaller units of carbohydrates  (glucose), proteins (amino acids) and fats \\n(fatty acids) are carried to the various parts of the body through the  bloodstream. In the body cells, carbohydrates and fats \\nare broken down or burnt to produce energy in the form of heat. Carbohydrates that are in excess of the body\\'s needs  are \\nconverted into fat and are stored in the body. Proteins are used for building new cells  during periods of growth and for \\nrepairing old and worn out ones when growth is  complete. The smaller units of proteins, left over after completing this \\nfunction are converted to body fat. However, if the calories produced by the fats and carbohydrates are  not adequate for \\nthe body, proteins are also converted to energy. \\nRefer to figure no.1.4.4b for digestion and absorption of food. \\n1.5 NUTRITION \\nNutrition science is defined by Robinson  as: \\n\"The science of foods, nutrients and other substances therein; their action, interaction and balance in relation to health \\nand disease; the process by which an organism ingests, digests, absorbs, transports and utilizes nutrients and disposes off \\ntheir end products\". \\nThus, the entire gamut of what foods are needed for maintaining good health, how they are processed to provide us the \\nwherewith to carry out our daily activities, and how the end products of the foods we ingest  or eat  are eliminated \\nconstitute the science of nutrition. \\nThe body\\'s needs change through the various stages of the life cycle. It is necessary to know how to  meet these needs by \\nproper selection and intake of foods. A person\\'s growth rate and size is decided by two main factors, one’s inborn capacity \\nto grow and environmental conditions. Nutrition is one of the major environmental conditions because  if our genes decide \\nhow tall we should be then our nutrition decides whether we reach such height or not. \\n \\nNutrition affects our body size, our pe rformance and our longetivity and good and bad nutrition can be gauged from \\nassessment of these three parameters. \\nBody size means our height; weight and skin fold thickness (to measure fat and lean muscle). Measurement of height, \\nweight and skin fold thickness are broad parameters to know whether we are in tune with genetic inhe ritance and are well \\nnourished.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"9 \\n \\nNutrition affects our ability to learn and retain information. As the brain is the fastest growing organ in the body, most of its \\ngrowth is over by the time a child is around two years old. So providing good nutrition to a pregnant and lactating mother, \\nan infant and a preschooler is very vital. After that age, it will be too late. Our ability to work is also an important aspect and \\nit totally depends on our nutrition. Underweight and malnourished individuals have physically weak b odies, low memory \\nand low immunity that often make them sick.  \\n \\nNutrition affects the longetivity of a person. Certain life threatening diseases like tuberculosis, anemia, and other childhood \\nailments increase mortality. Well-fed individuals are resistant to such diseases and live longer thus improving the country’s \\nhealth status and productivity. \\n \\nHence, nutrition is important from conception to old age for a disease free and long life. \\n \\n1.5.1 Normal nutrition \\nOur nutrition depends on many factors. Each one of us should have certain type of nutrition best suited for his or her body \\ntypes. Normal nutrition leads to good health. Good health has been defined as not only freedom from diseases but also a  \\nstate of complete physical, mental and spiritual well being. The requirements for good health are many and they are : \\n1. Optimal growth and development during childhood and adolescence  that leads to t he full expression of an \\nindividual's genetic potential.  Growth is defined in terms of physical features such as height and weight while \\ndevelopment includes all aspects of physical and mental development. \\n2. Maintaining structural and function al integrity of body  tissues throughout life that leads to an active and \\nproductive life. Exa mples include  moist, b right and sparkling eyes for good vision, s mooth and sof t skin that \\nprevents the entry of infections through the body surface, thus maintaining the integrity of internal organs like the \\ngastrointestinal tract and the liver for  proper digestion and assimilation of f oods and r emoval of toxic w aste \\nproducts. \\n3. Ability to perform mental tasks efficiently: Good nutrition is essential for children to develop cognitive skills, learn \\nschool-oriented tasks well, perform optimally,  and s tay on in school. Similarly good nutrition is impo rtant in \\nsustaining attention and memory in adults as well. \\n4. Ability to withstand the process of ageing with minimal disability. \\n5. Ability to combat diseases and resist infectio ns, and to minimize the effects  of environmental pollutants.  To \\nmaintain positive health, it is essenti al that we combine and consume a variety of  foods in such a way that the \\nnutrient needs for the above functions are all provided. \\nAlthough the principles of nutrition apply throughout the lifespan, greater emphasis is to provide enough food and care for \\nthe younger age groups. Young people from infancy through adolescence grow  continuously -- a characteristic that we  \\nadults do not share.  A child gets taller  and grows out of his clothes. Within two decades of life, a man  increases about 20 \\ntimes in weight and about 4 times in height (in comparison to his birth weight and height). Growth means increase in size of \\nthe body as well as development and maturation of the organs and systems of the body. Increase in size is visible externally \\nwhereas the development of organs and systems that takes place internally cannot be seen. \\nCritical periods of growth: \\nOur body grows in a set pattern with different tissues and parts of the body growing and maturing at different times. There \\nare three periods in a child's life, which  are critical because intensive growth occurs  here. Intensive growth includes \\ndevelopment of bones muscles and fat, development of other internal organs like brain, liver, kidney  and hormonal glands \\nand sexual maturation. If there is any adverse influence at these times; growth is affected and will slow down. \\nThe three periods are: \\n\\uf0b7 Prenatal period (nine months in the mother's womb) \\n\\uf0b7 First year of infancy \\n\\uf0b7 Adolescence (between 12 and 18 years) \\nWe can see the distinct differences in growth changes in both heights and weights of children in the following tables.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"10 \\n \\nRefer to table no 1.5.1a and 1.5.1b for growth pattern in critical stages \\nApart from these three stages, other critical stages where nutrition plays a vital role are pregnancy and lactation. These will \\nbe taken up in detail in further units. \\nWe need to consume a variety of foods in order to remain healthy and that calls for a balanced diet.. A simple thumb rule is \\nto classify foods into  different food groups. The basic seven -food groups’ concept is useful in getting a balanced diet that \\nhelps us to remain healthy. These basic seven food groups are:  \\n1)  Cereals and cereal products  \\n2)  Pulses (also meat and meat products)  \\n3)  Milk and milk products  \\n4)  Vegetables and fruits  \\n5)  Nuts and oil seeds  \\n6)  Fats and oils, and  \\n7)  Sugars \\nAn easy way to understand the balanced consumption of these seven food groups is represented as four  steps to a healthy \\ndiet. Our daily diets for maintaining  good health should be made up of generous amounts of vege tables and fruits, \\nadequate amounts of cereals, pulses, milk and milk products, moderate amounts of meat and flesh food s and limited \\nquantities of fats and oils, nuts and oil seeds and sugars.  The figure below shows general dietary guidelines for Indians, \\nwhich provide a foundation to nutrition and health. \\nEAT SPARINGLY Fat, Oils & sugars \\nEAT MODERATELY Meat & flesh foods \\nEAT LIBERALLY Vegetable & Fruits \\nEAT ADEQUATELY CEREALS , PULSES, MILK \\n \\nRefer to table no.1.5.1c for the food pyramid \\n 1.5.2 Malnutrition \\nMalnutrition is a state of improper nutrition balance in the body. While some people eat less than w hat they need others \\nconsume too much. Inadequate intake of food or a specific nutrient le ads to under nutrition, while over nutrition means \\nthat a person eats more food than he/she needs. Both under nutrition and over nutrition are two mani festations of \\nmalnutrition. \\nUnder nutrition:  \\nUnder nutrition affects growth in children, their physical and intellectual capacity and work perfor mance as well as \\nresistance to infection. It may even determine how long a person lives. Food is vital to life. If a child does not have enough \\nfood, it wil l not grow as it should. Naturally, such a child will be smaller in stature. If the deprivation is in the first two or \\nthree years of life, the child's brain will not grow fully. In addition, bones will not harden and new bones will not form.  \\nAn individual’s capacity to work and perform depends on he or she being in the best state of health. Hungry children cannot \\nconcentrate on their studies. Lack of sufficient food may reduce the desire or motivation to work. Under nutrition, \\ntherefore, can compromise physical, intellectual and emotional performance. Deficiency of a single nutrient also has similar \\neffects. People who have inadequate food are generally thin and underweight. Food provides with substances that protect \\nus against disease. Undernourished pe ople will not be able to resist infection effectively. If we are ill , we do not feel like\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='11 \\n \\neating much. The more severe the illness, the greater will be our lack of appetite and the less our food intake. At the same \\ntime our body needs more food in order t o combat infection. If we have diarrhea or worms, we will not be able to absorb \\nnutrients as we do normally. This will eventually lead to under nutrition and diseases. \\nOver nutrition and obesity: \\nOver nutrition is consumption of more food than we need. The most common problem of over nutrition is overweight and \\nobesity. When we consume more energy than we spend, i.e. more than we need, our body stores the extra energy as fat. \\nA comparison of weight is done with standard tables, which gives \"ideal\" weight according to height, age and sex. If weight \\nis more than 10 per cent above the \\'ideal\" weight, then the person is considered overweight and if it is 15 or 20 per cent \\nmore, then obese. Over nutrition and obese people tend to suffer from hypertension, stroke, diabetes, heart disease etc. \\nThey feel uneasy because of excess fat around their chest and tire easily. Fat people may also die at a young age. \\nReducing the amount of food so  that the energy intake is less than energy expenditure is t he best way to counter \\noverweight problems. One kg of fat in the body stores 7700 kcals. One can lose this extra kg of weight in two weeks by \\nconsuming 500 kcals less. These 500 kcals can be reduced by curtailing one\\'s intake of oily foods, sweets, starchy foods, and \\nif necessary, some cereals and dals. Such a person can be advised to have a well balanced diet  when he is trying to reduce \\nweight. One should also be advised to do some exercise and be active so that he increases his energy expenditure. \\nRefer to table no. 1.5.2a for weight for height for males (overweight & underweight limits) \\nRefer to table no. 1.5.2b for weight for height for females (overweight & underweight limits) \\nDetection of malnutrition: \\nApart from physical symptoms and diet asses sment, malnutrition has to  be assessed clinically before prescribing diet \\nchanges. \\nOne of the first steps in detecting malnutrition is to check the person’s diet. T his is then compared with the daily food \\nguide. This will show whether one is getting too little or too much of a particular food group. Next, the weight of the person \\nis compared with the standard available. If the person is slightly underweight it may not matter much, but if he is drastically \\nunderweight, it means that he is undernourished. Next simple physical check up of the person’s  mouth, skin, eyes, inner \\nlining of the eyelids, tongue and lower limbs is done. Lack of many nutrients affects these parts of the body. If the skin is \\nrough and scaly or if there are cracks at the corners of the mouth, cracks on the lips, bleeding gums, it could be due to lack \\nof several vitamins. If the inner lining of the eyelid is pale, the person could be anemic. All these changes occur because of \\ntaking insufficient food. \\n1.5.3           Nutritional status \\nNutritional status is the level of nourishment of our body. Each of us would like to have a good nutritional status. So far, we \\nhave learnt that nutrition affects our body size, our brain develo pment, our performance, our capacity to work and life \\nspan. Nutritional status shows the kind  of nourishment our b ody gets from the foods we eat.  If foods provide s for our  \\nbody\\'s needs optimally, we look and feel healthy and enjoy a good nutritional status. \\nIndicators of good nutritional status are: \\n1. Measurement of body size: \\nWe have learnt that body weight and height indicate our body size. In addition, the head, chest and mid arm \\ncircumferences give an idea of growth and development, especially of small children (0-5 years). Therefore, we record these \\nbody measurements at various stages of development to study the growth pattern and check the nutritional status. \\n\\uf0b7 Weight: Weight is a commonly used indicator of body size, as it reflects the level of food intake. \\nThe weight of children is recorded regularly to check if there is a normal gain. The weight can be plotted against age to \\nsee if the pattern of growth is normal, by comparing it with the normal curve. If a  child fails to gain weight, and does'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"12 \\n \\nnot follow a normal pattern of growth, we must find the reason and take remedial action. We can do the same with \\nadults by comparing their weights with their corresponding heights in order to know their nutritional status. \\nLinear Measurements: Measurements of height, circumferences of head, chest and mid -arm, and skin fold thickness \\nare also known as linear measurements. \\n2. Dietary assessment:  \\nWe have learnt that nutritional status is affected by the amounts and kinds of foods we normally eat . We take physical \\nmeasurements to assess the nutritional status (condition). If the condition is not satisfactory, we will want to modify \\nthe diet. This is done by assessing the present food intake pattern of the individual to be able to modify it suitably. \\nHence, the dietary assessment needs to be carried out. \\n  When and How to Record Food Intake: \\nWe need to know the normal or habitual pattern of food intake. Therefore, we select three normal working days to \\nrecord the food intake, which does not include Sundays, holidays , festivals as generally these days have special \\nmenus, and the schedule of eating is different . We write down the foods they eat each day at each meal. The \\nsnacks, fruits and beverages they take between the meals or with the meals are also recorded. Record the amount \\nof each preparation eaten and  also the time when it was eaten. The amount can be recorded in volume or weight. \\nLater we can convert all the amounts into weights. \\nEvaluation of Food Intake Data \\nWe can evaluate the food intake to check h ow the food selection compares with the daily food guide. This is \\nqualitative check and will help to identify if any of the food groups are missing from the day's intake. Secondly, one \\ncan compare the amounts of foods taken with the suggested minimum number of servings to see if the amounts of \\nfoods included are insufficient. This evaluation will help to decide what changes need to be made in  the diet to \\nimprove the nutritional status. \\n1.6 SUMMARY \\nConsumption of nutritious diet in right (ideal) amount and proportion helps in maintenance of good health. Therefore, a \\ngood knowledge and understanding of the food sources of these various nutritional  components, their metabolism, and \\ntheir requirements for different age and physiological groups is an essential prerequisite for maintaining good health. This \\ncourse is an attempt to provide this knowledge and skills. \\nThe last three decades has seen a tremendous progress in nutrition. Although the  importance of nutrition in growt h, \\ndevelopment and the prevention of nutritional  deficiency diseases was well recognized it is only in the last  three decades \\nthat the frontiers of nutritional science has expanded to include newer  and more dimensions of health such as prevention \\nof chronic degenerative diseases, retardation of ageing and promotion of mental well being. \\nHuman beings require a large number of nutrients, about 40, for many of which the  requirements are well established. In \\naddition, recent advances have shown that the diet components like carotenoid pigments, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, \\nanthocyanins, lignins etc.are bioactive compounds with a potential role in the prevention of  degenerative diseases and in \\ndetoxification. \\nThe earlier dictum that if the diet provided adequa te energy to meet our requirements,  then it is likely to be adequate in \\nother respects, is no longer true. We have to make  conscious efforts to have a healthy diet. If we are a nutrition \\nprofessional or a dietitian, then we also 'have the responsibility of planning diets for others both for health and in diseases \\nand in addition, we will be counseling a large number of people on appropriate diets.\"),\n",

In this unit, we shall learn about the classification of food, th eir composition, function \\nand sources. This study shall also provide the basis for planning menus and modifying diets for normal individuals as well as \\npatients. \\nClassification of foods: \\nAll foods are classified into three broad categories:- \\n\\uf0b7 Energy yielding foods (Carbohydrates and Fats) \\n\\uf0b7 Body building foods (proteins) \\n\\uf0b7 Protective  and  regulatory foods( vitamins, minerals and other foods) \\nWe will learn about energy yielding foods and body building foods in this chapter.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='21 \\n \\nEnergy yielding foods as the name suggests provide your body with energy to perform all tasks (volun tary or involuntary). \\nThese foods contain energy giving nutrients like carbohydrate and fats. To some extent protein in the body can also be used \\nby the body to generate energy but that happens only in cases where there is shortage of the other t wo nutrients. While \\ncarbohydrates are an instant source of energy, fats are concentrated fo rm of energy and are stored as reserves as body fat \\nand used when required. \\nBody building foods are which help an infant to grow into an adult and an adult to maintain health. Such foods are protein \\nrich foods as they perform the vital function of growth, repair and maintenance of your body. They include dairy products, \\nmeat, fish and poultry and soya bean. \\n2.2  Classification of Carbohydrates \\nEnergy must be supplied regularly to us through the diet for our survival and maintenance of life an d to carry out all \\nactivities jointly termed as work. Our body derives energy from the catabolism of energy -yielding nutrients: carbohydrates, \\nlipids and proteins. Among these, carbohydrates are the single most abundant source of dietary energ y comprising 50-70% \\nof the total energy intake in different populations. We will learn about the different types of carbohydrates, their utilization \\nby the body and how glucose homeostasis is maintained. In addition, the health benefits of dietary fiber and carbohydrates \\nnot absorbed in the small intestines will also be covered in this unit. \\nCarbohydrates are divided into three major groups: \\n\\uf0b7 Sugars,  \\n\\uf0b7 starches,  \\n\\uf0b7 Cellulose and related material.  \\nCarbohydrates are compounds of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen and their chemical structures are  all based on a common \\nunit of glucose. The units are linked together in many ways and in different numbers to form differe nt carbohydrates. The \\nclassification of carbohydrates depends primarily on the number of units, which may vary from one to  many thous ands. \\nWhile sugars and starches are a major source of your food energy, cellulose is one of the main const ituent of dietary fibre \\nfound in food. \\n2.2.1    Sugars \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Monosaccharide or simple sugar: \\no Glucose, also known as dextrose is found naturally in fruits and plants juices and in the blood of living animals. \\nMost carbohydrates in food are ultimately converted to glucose after digestion. Glucose can also be \\nmanufactured from starch by the action of acid or specific enzymes. Artificially manufactured glucos e syrups \\nalso known as liquid glucose are used to manufacture foods like soft drinks, jams and sugar confectionary. \\no Fructose also occurs naturally in some fruits and vegetables and especially in honey. It is the sweetest sugar. It \\nis also a component of sucrose and is also present in commercial ‘high fructose’ syrups. \\no Galactose is a part of lactose and does not occur in free state. \\n\\uf0b7 Disaccharides \\n      Disaccharides consists of two monosaccharides linked together minus              the elements of water. \\no Sucrose occurs naturally is sugar cane and sugar beet and in lesser amounts in fruits and some root v egetables \\nlike carrots. It is chemical combination of glucose and fructose. The ‘sugar’ that we eat, whether w hite or \\nbrown and essentially pure sucrose. \\no Maltose is a combination of 2 glucose units and is formed during the breakdown of starch by digestion.  Malt is \\nalso formed when grain is germinated for production of malt liquor(beer). \\no Lactose is a combination of glucose and galactose and occurs only in milk, including human milk. It is less sweet \\nthan sucrose or glucose. \\n\\uf0b7 Properties of sugars \\n\\uf0b7 All sugars (monosaccharides and disaccharides) dissolve in water and are varying sweet in taste. The y form \\nwhite or colourless crystals and their taste can be modified b y cooking (caramelization). Sugars are a readily \\navailable source of energy and sweetness and also widely used in food industry like jam making, cann ing, \\nfreezing (as preservatives), biscuits, cakes, soft drinks, chocolates (to provide texture and consistency).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='22 \\n \\n2.2.2  Starch \\n \\nStarches are polysaccharides are composed of large number of glucose units linked together to form b oth straight and \\nbranched chains. They exist in granules of a size and shape characteristic for each plant. So the st arch of a potato is \\ndifferent from the starch found in flour 9wheat0. In the raw form they are indigestible but when hea ted or cooked in the \\npresence of water, the starch granules swell and eventually gelatinize. This makes them more easy to digest. \\nGlycogen is similar to starch in composition but is made from glucose only by animals and not by plants. Small amoun ts are \\nstored in the liver and muscles which act as an energy reserve. \\n \\n2.2.3  Cellulose and related materials \\n \\nThese polysaccharides provide structure to vegetables, fruits and grains and make them rigid and fibrous. These structures \\nenclose the starch granules. They are insoluble in water. Together with lignin (which is not a carbo hydrate), they are the \\nmain component of dietary fibre. Cellulose consists of many thousands of glucose units. It cannot be digested by man, but is \\na food of cows and other nutrients. Cellulose and certain other indigestible polysaccharides add bul k to faeces because of \\ntheir water binding capacity and assist in passage of indigestible materials and waste products through the intestines which \\nis very important to human health. \\n2.2.4 Sources and functions of carbohydrates \\nSources: Plants form sugars in their leaves by the action of sunlight and store them in their roots, stems, t ubers, and seeds \\nas starch. This starch is a major energy reserve for most plants and thus in turn provides a major p art of man’s food energy \\nas well. Apart from sugars like lactose and fructose which are available from milk and fruits and ho ney respectively, other \\nsugars would not have been available through diet without the addition of sucrose and glucose syrups  in jams, cakes, \\nbiscuits, ice cream etc.which are a part of our daily diet today.  \\nHence main sources of  \\nSugars in diet are sugar, sweets, chocolates, milk, fruit, fruit products, biscuits, cakes and main sources of  \\nStarches are bread, potatoes, cereal products \\nFibre are vegetables and cereal products. \\n \\nRefer to Table 2.2.4 for different types of carbohydrates and their sources. \\n Functions: Carbohydrates in the body function primarily in the form of glucose, although a few have structural roles. \\nImportant functions of carbohydrates are: \\n\\uf0b7 Source of energy: Glucose is a major source of energy for all the body cells. One gram of carbohydrate provides 4 \\nKcal. RBCs are particularly dependent on glucose. It is also indispensable for the maintenance of func tional \\nintegrity of the nerve tissue and under normal circumstances; it is the sole source of energy for the brain. Similarly, \\nglucose is important for hear t muscles. Although fatty acids are the preferred regular fuel of heart muscle, \\nglycogen in cardiac muscle is an important emergency source of contractile energy. In a damaged hear t, poor \\nglycogen stores or low carbohydrate intake may cause cardiac symptoms of angina. \\n\\uf0b7 Protein sparing effect : Carbohydrates help in regulating the protein metabolism. Presence of sufficient \\ncarbohydrates to meet energy demands prevents the channeling of too much protein for this purpose. This protein \\nsparing action allows the m ajor portions of protein to be used for its basic structural purpose of tissue building. \\nTherefore, patients who are unable to eat are temporarily administered 5% glucose solution intravenously. \\n\\uf0b7 Antiketogenic effect : Presence of carbohydrates is necessary for normal fat metabolism. In the absence of \\nsufficient carbohydrates, larger amounts of fat are used for energy than the body is equipped to han dle. This \\nresults in incomplete oxidation and accumulation of ketone bodies. This may in turn lead to acidosis , sodium \\nimbalance and dehydration. In extreme conditions such as starvation (carbohydrates are inadequate) a nd \\nuncontrolled diabetes (where carbohydrates are unavailable for energy needs), ketoacidosis is a comm on \\ncomplication. \\n\\uf0b7 Excretion of toxins : Glucuronic acid, a metabolite of glucose, combines with chemical and bacterial toxins and \\nsome normal metabolites in the liver and thereby helps in their excretion.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='23 \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Act as precursors : Carbohydrates and their derivatives serve as precursors to compounds su ch as nucleic acid, \\nconnective tissue matrix and galactoside of nerve tissue. \\n\\uf0b7 Overall positive health : Non-glycemic carbohydrates including non -starch polysaccharides ar e beneficial for the \\nfunction and physiology of gastrointestinal tract and thus have a positive effect on the overall health. \\n \\n2.2.5 Digestion and Absorption \\nDietary carbohydrates, which are primarily present as polysaccharides (starch) followed by disacchar ide and free \\nmonosaccharide, supply 60 -70% of energy to the body. However, monosaccha rides are present in very small amounts in \\nour diet. To be absorbed from the gut, carbohydrates must be broken down to their constituent monosa ccharide units.  \\nLet’s see how these carbohydrates are digested in the gut. \\n Refer to Table 2.2.5 for Digestion of carbohydrates. \\nGlucose and galactose are absorbed into the mucosal cells. Glucose and galactose cannot attach to the carrier until it has  \\nbeen preloaded with sodium as illustrated ill Figure 3.2. Hence, you would realize that oral rehydra tion syrup (ORS) always \\ncontains sodium chloride and glucose / sugar. Fructose is absorbed by a facilitated transport, involving a specific \\ntransporter- GLUT-5.GLUTS or human glucose transporters are the integral proteins, which penetrate and span the lipid \\nbilayer of plasma membrane. \\nFollowing absorption, the monosaccharides enter the portal circulation and are carried to the liver.  Both galactose and \\nfructose are converted to glucose in the hepatocytes. A part of glucose is converted into glycogen while some is catabolized \\nfor energy in the liver. The remainder of glucose passes on into the systemic blood supply and is di stributed among other \\ntissues such as skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and kidney. \\nGlycemic Index \\nWe know that some carbohydrates are rapidly digested and  absorbed, some are digested slowly while some are not \\ndigested at all. Thus, it is obvious that different carbohydrates will raise blood glucose levels to  a different extent. The \\nability of carbohydrates to raise blood glucose is, referred to as  \"Glycemic Index\" (GI). GI is a quantitative assessment of \\nfoods based on postprandial blood glucose response (i.e. blood glucose level after a meal) expressed as a \\'percentage of the \\nresponse to an equivalent carbohydrate portion of a reference food\\'. The reference food is white bread with a GI set at 100.  \\nKnowing about GI of foods helps us in prescribing therapeutic diets like diabetic and energy -controlled diets You would \\nrealize that the dietary GI provides an indication of the rate at which, carbohydrate foods are digested. It allows ranking of \\nfoods from those which give rise to the highest blood glucose and insulin responses (high glycernic food) to those \\nassociated with the lowest blood glucose and insulin responses (low GI foods).High GI foods lead to a rapid rise in blood \\nglucose and insulin levels. Hyper - insulinemia in turn may down regulate insulin receptors and therefore reduce insulin \\nefficiency resulting in insulin resistance. On the contrary, low GI foods result in reduced peak ins ulin concentrations and \\nreduced insulin demand thus decreasing the risk of type I1 diabetes. \\nThe health benefits include reduced insulin demand, improved blood glucose control and reduced blood  lipid levels. All \\nthese factors play an important role in the prevention and manag ement of chronic diseases including diabetes, coronary \\nheart disease and certain cancers \\n2.2.6 Nutritional requirement and health aspects \\nIn our daily diet almost 60-70% of energy is contributed by carbohydrates. Majority of them are comprised of starch (f rom \\ncereals, millets, pulses and root vegetables), while a small amount is also contributed by sucrose ( sugar), glucose and \\nfructose (fruits), as well as, lactose (milk and milk products). \\nIn certain disorders changes need to be made. \\n\\uf0b7 Lactose intolerance: In case of lactose intolerance, the ingestion of lactose leads to passage of the sugar to the \\nlarge bowel, where it is fermented to produce SCFA and gases, which causes discomfort. Lactose is present in dairy \\nproducts such as milk, cheese, yoghurt, ice cream etc. Hence, these foods need to be avoided.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"24 \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Diabetes mellitus : Diabetes may be diagnosed as an exaggerated response in blood glucose concentration \\nfollowing ingestion of a fixed amount of glucose (glucose tolerance test). The most common forms of diabetes are \\ninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM or type I diabetes) and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM \\nor type 2 diabetes).IDDM results from the autoimmune destruction of the a -cells the endocrine pancreas, the \\nconsequence of which is insulin insufficiency. In this, the patient requires exogenous supply of insulin. The amount \\nof carbohydrate and frequency of feeding is modified and depends on the insulin dose, type of insuli n and the \\nweight of the person. \\n \\nHealth aspects: \\nThe main work of all sugar and starches (carbohydrates) are to provide energy to the body but they also have physio logical \\nimpact as well. Excessive consumption of sugars is associated with tooth decay, obesity, heart disea ses and bowel diseases \\nlike appendicitis and bow el cancer. However, when low fat diets are eaten, energy can be supplied by fiber rich starchy \\nfoods rather than sugar diets. For some people especially children, digesting lactose is a problem a nd results in digestive \\ndisturbances. This is also known as lactose intolerance.  \\n \\nBlood glucose regulation: \\nNormally after a meal, when blood glucose levels increase, the peptide hormones (such as cholecystok inin) secreted from \\nenteroendocrine cells within the mucosa of the small bowel amplify the response of the b -cells of pancreas resulting in the \\nsecretion of insulin. Insulin facilitates the transport of glucose by glucose transporter - GLUT 4 into the adipocytes and \\nmuscle cells and stimulates glycogenesis (synthesis of glycogen) and fatty acid biosynthesis, thu s returning the blood \\nglucose to homeostatic level. \\nThis is when the glucose level is high in blood. However, when glucose level falls in case of post a bsorptive state, the fall in \\nblood glucose level signals the reversal of the pancreatic hormonal secreti on i.e. decreased insulin and increased glucagon \\nrelease. Blood glucose levels are maintained by the breakdown of glycogen and in this way, the gluco se demands of brain, \\nRBCs and testis are met. \\nToo much of fluctuation in this process leads to diabetes. \\nDiabetes, which is a metabolic disorder and effects the normal lifestyle of an individual is also rela ted to the amount of \\nglucose in the blood. Diabetics have to monitor and control their total carbohydrate intake in order  to keep diabetes under \\ncheck. \\nRefer to table 2.2.6 for regulation of blood glucose \\nCarbohydrate malabsorption:  Carbohydrates malabsorption is usually caused by an inherited or acquired (intestinal \\ninfection, celiac disease, PEM) defect in the brush border oligosaccharidases, the most common being 'lactose intolerance'. \\nIn such individuals, ingestion of lactose leads to passage of the sugar to the large bowel, where it  is fermented to produce \\nshort chain fatty acids (SCFA) and gases. In humans, lactase activity declines as individuals grow. \\n2.3  Classification of Fats \\nHere we will learn in detail the types and functions of fats and oils, their requirements and significance in our overall health. \\nToday changing dietary patterns and sedentary lifestyles are leading to high risk of some diseases, especially heart diseases. \\nOn the other hand, smart decisions on qualitative and quantitative aspects of fat in diet can in fac t prevent the onset of \\ncertain diseases associated with today’s lifestyles. \\nAt the end of this unit, there are self assess ment exercises to recapitulate various dimensions of knowledge regarding \\ndietary fats and oils. You will acquire adequate skills and confidence to prescribe fats and oils to  any community. Tips are \\ngiven to reduce fat intake in diets which will come handy in counseling patients of obesity, heart diseases, diabetes and \\ncancer. You will be able to modify fat intake of patients with fat malabsorption and liver diseases.  \\nFats and oils, are also chemically known as  lipids. Lipids which are solid at room tempera ture are referred to as fats and \\nthose which are liquid at room temperature are called oils.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='25 \\n \\nIn nutrition textbooks, fats and oils are referred in diets and lipids are referred in body fluids, like, serum lipid profile . \\nChemically, lipids are the organic molecules poor in oxygen content, soluble in organic solvents but insoluble in water. They \\nare classified as: \\n\\uf0b7 Simple lipids \\n\\uf0b7 Compound lipids and \\n\\uf0b7 Derived lipids \\nLet us get to know each one of these. \\n\\uf0b7 Simple lipids  are fatty acid esters of glycerol, called triacyglycerols or triglycerides (for e.g. fats and oils) or higher \\nalcohols (for e.g. waxes).Triglycerides is the major form of lipids present in human diets. They are  the major sources of \\nfatty acids to the body.  \\n\\uf0b7 Compound lipids  are the simple lipids wh ich combine with proteins (lipoproteins), carbohydrates (glycolipids), \\nphosphates (phospholipids) etc. \\n\\uf0b7 Derived lipids refer to fatty acids, glycerol, cholesterol and other derived compounds including fat -soluble vitamins, \\nhormones and bile. Man can synthesize cholesterol in the body but some amount also comes from the diet. Cholesterol \\nis present only in foods of animal origin. \\nNature of fatty acids present in the triglyceride determines the physio-chemical properties and biological significance of the \\nlipid. Triglycerides made of saturated fatty acids are solids at room temperature and are called fats. If unsaturated fatty \\nacids are present, they are liquid at room temperature and are called oils. What do we mean by saturated and unsaturated \\nfatty acids? Let us understand fatty acids in a little more detail. \\n2.3.1  Fatty acids \\nFatty acids are categorized as: \\n\\uf0b7 Saturated and Unsaturated, - \\n\\uf0b7 Short chain, medium chain and long chain, \\n\\uf0b7 Essential fatty acids, and \\n\\uf0b7 Trans-fatty acids. \\nThese categories are more suitable from the nutritional standpoint of view and are not essentially exclusive as the fatty \\nacids may overlap in these categories but their applications in normal and therapeutic diets warrant s this classification. For \\nexample, a dietitian prescribes medium cha in triglycerides in liver disorders but on the other hand, saturated fatty acid \\nintake should be limited in normal diets for prevention of heart diseases. \\nSo, then, let us now get to know them. \\nSaturated fatty acids (SFA)  are those fatty acids which lack double bond, like palmitic acid (16:0), stearic acid (18:O) etc. \\nAnimal fats, coconut oil, palm oil and vanaspati are good sources of SFA.  \\nMonounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) contain a single double bond. \\nThe examples include palmito oleic acid (16: 1) and oleic acid (18: 1). Its sources are olive oil, canola oil, groundnut oil, rice \\nbran oil, red palm oil and sesame oil. \\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) contain more than one double bond in their structure. These double bo nds can be \\ncounted from -COOH end or -CH3 end. Linoleic \\nacid (C18:2, n-6) and Linolenic acid (18:3, n-3) are essential fatty acids, which are \\nnot synthesized in the body. They are obtained from oils rich in PUFA content. PUFA is present  mostly in vegetable oils \\nbut fish oil is particularly rich. Linoleic acid is also known as as omega 6 fatty acid and linolenic acid as omega 3 fatty acid. \\n.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='26 \\n \\nShort chain fatty acids are less than six carbon chain length i.e. smaller than caproic acid (C6:O). Butter contains small chain \\nfatty acids. They are also obtained during fermentation. \\nMedium chain fatty acids are 6-10 carbon chain length. They are present in butter and coconut oil. They are recommended \\nin liver disorders due to ease in their absorption. \\nLong chain fatty acids contain more than 12 carbon chain. Essential fatty acids are all long chain fatty acids.  \\nWhat are essential fatty acids and their roles in our body? \\nEssential Fatty Acids (EFA) \\nThere are two essential fatty acids - linoleic and linolenic acid as mentioned above. Their structures are depicted in Box 5.2. \\nThey are both 18 carbon compounds with more than one double bond. Omega - 3 (n-3) and omega-6 (n-6) fatty acids need \\nto be derived from the daily diets. These are known to be cardio -protective and are also present in fish oil. Omega 3 and \\nOmega 6 fatty acids are part of vital body structures and have an important  role in immune system, formation of cell \\nmembrane and in  production of  hormone -like compounds called eicosanoids. These hormone -like compounds include \\nprostacyclins, prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes. These compounds are potent regulators of vital body \\nfunctions like blood pressure, child birth, blood clotting, immune response, inflammatory responses and stomach \\nsecretions. \\nWhat do we mean by trans-fatty acids? \\nTrans fatty acids \\nTrans-fatty acids are produced when vegetable oils are hydrogenated to make margarines, partially hydrogen ated \\nvegetable shortening and vanaspati. Hence, major sources of trans -fatty acids to hurnan diets are commercially baked \\nproducts, deep fried snacks in vanaspati and sweets. Small amount of trans -fatty acids are also present in milk fat.  \\nMetabolically, trans-fatty acids and saturated fatty acids raise blood cholesterol levels. \\nRefer to table 2.3.1 for different types of fats and oils & their fatty acids \\n2.3.2  Sources of fats and functions of fats \\nVegetable sources: In plants fats are formed from carbohydrates. When seeds such as sunflower and cottonseed ripen, \\ntheir starch content decreases as their fat content rises. Oilseeds such as these and ground nuts, coconuts, rapeseeds, palm \\nkernels and soya beans contain about 20 to 40 percent of oil and are chiefly used in manufacture of margarine. \\nAnimal sources: Animals including man store excess energ y almost entirely in deposits of fat, the amount of which is \\nvariable. Like in plants this fat can be made from carbohydrates. But animals can also lay down fat from their dietary fat. Fat \\nin diet comes mainly from milk and milk products, fatty fish, meat and poultry which are all animal sources. \\nFunctions of Fats: \\n\\uf0b7 Fats contribute to texture, flavour; taste and increase palatability of the diet. They provide an effective medium of heat \\ntransfer in deep-frying and transfer of flavours from Indian spices. \\n\\uf0b7 Fats have highest heat energy density of 9 Kcal/g. It is the major storage form of energy in body requiring least space \\nand minimum water or hydration as compared to protein in muscle. \\n\\uf0b7 Fats are essential for meeting nutritional needs of essential fatty acids like linoleic acid (n-6) and alpha linolenic acid (n-\\n3). Saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol can be synthesized in the bod y, hence the diet \\nonly adds-on to their total amount available in the body.  \\n\\uf0b7 Fats promote absorption of fat soluble vitamins like vitamin A, D, E and K. \\n\\uf0b7 Fat intake ensures satiety. It imparts feeling of fullness and satisfaction and thus delays onset of hunger. In low fat \\ndiets, satiety can be ensured by high fibre and fluid intake. \\n\\uf0b7 Fats along with proteins constitute structural components of cell membrane and some body fluids. Lipoproteins also \\nhave an important role in transport of lipids in blood.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"27 \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Fats serve as thermal insulator in the subcutaneous tissues and certain organs. Some lipids act as electrical insulators \\nallowing rapid propagation of depolarization waves along the myelinated nerves. The fat content of the nervous tissues \\nis particularly high. In anorexia nervosa, the body fat falls dangerously low (< 5%) shows problems i n insulation. Body \\nhair stands erect to trap air and simulate insulation. \\n\\uf0b7 Some dietary fats contain antioxidants. Most of them contain antioxidants which confer stability to the oil and prevent \\nrancidity. For example, OryznnoE (1.2-1.7%) in physically refi ned rice bran oil helps to elevate HDL, decrease plasma \\ncholesterol, treat nerve imbalance, menopause disorders, retard ageing and acts as anti -dandruff and anti -itching \\nagent. Tocotrienols, tocopherols and squalene are antioxidants conferring oxidative stability to the oil. \\n2.3.3  Nutritional requirement of fats and health aspects \\nJust like the other macronutrients, requirements of visible fats for all age groups are computed and guidelines are given for \\nselection of fats. For this, we must consider the to tal fat intake, which includes both visible and invisible fat in food. Let us \\ntake a look at the total fat requirements to meet minimum essential fatty acid requirements in all age groups. We start with \\nadults. \\n\\uf0b7 Adults \\nA desirable amount of a linoleic acid to be consumed by a normal adult is 3en% (ICMR, 1990). The invisible fat present in \\nthe usual Indian foods is high in linoleic acid content (rice, wheat, bengal gram, red gram). Hence an average Indian has \\nsufficient linoleic acid in his diet. 5 en% in a 2400 Kcal diet works out to be 12 g / day. This implies that 3 tsp of cooking oil \\nor table fat a day meets adult requirements. \\n\\uf0b7 Pregnancy and Lactation \\nLinoleic acid requirements should be raised to 4.5 en% during pregnancy This can be met from 30 g/d of oil which has >20% \\nlinoleic acid. Similarly, linoleic acid requirement during lactation rises to 5.7 en% which corresponds to 45 g oil intake which \\nhas > 20% of linoleic acid. \\n\\uf0b7 Infancy \\nAdequate breast-feeding ensures 30 g fat intake by infants, of which 10% is linoleic acid and 1% is linolenic acid, which \\nmeets EFA needs of infants of 6 -enpercentage. Infants who are weaned completely or partially should be given enough \\nvegetable oil with a high linoleic acid content to ensu re 6 en% of linoleic acid. Research indicates that  n -3 fatty acids are \\nhighly essential for infants as they are particularly important for brain development. Hence it is important to include DHA or  \\ndocosa-hexaenoic acid . \\n\\uf0b7 Young and Older Children \\nYoung c hildren need 3 en%, which can be easily met from 8 -10 g of oil in diet. However, more visible oil is needed to \\nimprove energy density of diets otherwise cereal based diets become bulky. ICMR (1990) recommends 20  g/d in children's \\ndiet from oil which has at least 20% linoleic acid. \\nRefer to table 2.3.3 for fat requirements of Indians. \\nChoice of Cooking Medium in Indian Diets \\nICMR (1998) has given dietary guidelines to maintain n -6: n-3 ratio of 5:10, which ensures long term health. For ensuring \\nthe appropriate balance of fatty acids in cereal -based diets and in the diets of those who do not eat fish and are primarily \\nvegetarians like in the case of many Indian diets, we need to depend on plant foods rich in linoleni c acid for ex. wheat, \\nbajra, blackgram, cowpea, rajmah, soybean, green leafy vegetables, fenugreek and mustard seeds .\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"28 \\n \\n \\nThe choice of cooking oil should be: \\na) Moderate linoleic acid content oils like groundnut oil, rice bran oil or sesame oil \\nOr \\nSoyabean oil (containing both linoleic and alpha linolenic acid), and \\nb) Combination of two oils in approximately equal proportion like High linoleic acid oils like sunflower oil, safflower oil and \\ncottonseed oil with palm oil (low linoleic acid) \\nOr \\nMustard Oil.(containing alpha -linolenic acid) along with any other cooking oil (this will reduce erucic acid from \\nmustard oil and thereby its undesirable health effects) \\n \\nChanging Trends in Dietary Intake of fats \\nA minimum amount of fat according to guidelines is essential for the body and is calculated above but the fact that diseases \\nlike obesity, heart diseases and cancer are on a rise especially in affluent societies can be attributed to the changing dietary \\nand lifestyle practices coupled with stress. Now there is a need to decide on the upper limit of fat  c onsumption as well. \\nContemporary society is showing nutritional transition and access to fast foods and fried snacks while eating out is in vogue. \\nThis leads to an increased intake of saturated fatty acid, milk and milk products, flesh foods and s ugar instead of whole \\ncereals, millets and pulses. This is likely to decrease EFA intake from invisible sources and raise SFA. The total calories a re \\nalso high, especially if accompanied by alcohol consumption. \\nWe have already discussed that fried foods and baked p roducts could be a source of trans -fatty acids. Further, the quality \\nand source of frying oil is not known. May be the oil used is highly reused and abused. It is  alway s better to select dishes  \\nprepared by other cooking methods like boiling, steaming, bra ising etc. than frying for lesser oil intake. Dish selection and \\nbehavior modifications are vital to avoid high fat intake. \\nHealth aspects: \\nDiseases due to excessive consumption of fat and their preventive methods: \\nThree diseases have shown close link to excessive dietary fat intake: obesity, heart diseases and cancer. \\n\\uf0b7 Obesity: \\nIn obesity, cutting down total energy intake or increasing output to ensure energy balance is the ba sic principle of \\nprevention. Fat being energy dense is always dangerous in large amounts.Selection of foods and modified cooking methods \\nfurther prevent excessive fat intake. Low fat diets should be given with high fibre and fluid diet t o ensure compliance and \\nsatiety. \\n\\uf0b7 Heart disease: \\nHeart diseases show strong links to fat and cholesterol intake. Foods rich in cholesterol are of ani mal origin .Higher dietary \\ncholesterol increases blood cholesterol but high blood cholesterol with family history does not nece ssarily gain on \\ncholesterol-free diet. Both drug and low cholesterol diet is recommended. Vegetable oils have no cholesterol. \\nThe reference of 'good' and 'bad' cholesterol to dietary fats is in reference to the effect in blood  lipids and HDL/LDL ratio . \\nHigh intakes of n -6 polyunsatura ted fats have been associated with the reduced total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol \\nconcentrations that are associated with low risk of CHD. In general, epidemiological studies have de monstrated an inverse \\nassociation between n -6 polyunsaturated fatty aci d intake and risk of CHD. N -3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (particularly, \\neicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) have been shown to reduce the risk of CH D and stroke by a \\nmultitude of mechanisms:  \\n\\uf0b7 by preventing arrhythmias,  \\n\\uf0b7 reducing atherosclerosis,  \\n\\uf0b7 decreasing platelet aggregation,\"),\n",

High fat intake is indicated as a risk factor to cancer of breas t, colon etc. Saturated f at \\nintake is seen as a cause in many cancer events. Cooking in re -used oil produces free radicals in body, which promote \\ncarcinogenesis.  \\nReducing fat intake \\n\\uf0b7 Avoid baked foods except bread. Avoid buttered toasts. Avoid eggs as they are rich in cholesterol. \\n\\uf0b7 Reduce number of cooked preparations. Each Indian preparation needs a lot of fat.  \\n\\uf0b7 Modify standard Indian recipe for low fat cooki ng. Use non-stick pan, less greasy gravy and topping of extra ghee. Dry \\nroasting should be preferred over frying using plenty of ghee.. \\n\\uf0b7  Limit non-vegetarian foods, prefer fish. \\n\\uf0b7  Prefer skimmed milk, even in yoghurt, cottage cheese etc. \\n\\uf0b7 Avoid eating out on a regular basis or purchasing food. Do not select fried foods, pizza with extra cheese, creamed \\nsoups, fried rice and noodles. \\n\\uf0b7 When eating out, keep in mind hygienic handling and select soups (no cream or butter), sprout salads, fruits, cocktails. \\n\\uf0b7  Prefer cooking methods like steaming, boiling, stewing. Avoid frying. Indian curry making includes f rying of onion, \\nginger and garlic paste in a good amount of fat. \\n\\uf0b7 Among desserts, prefer fresh fruit and non -thickened milk puddings made from s kimmed milk. Avoid pastries, ice \\ncreams, egg custard, kheer, kulfi etc. \\n\\uf0b7 Aim to eat no more than 3 tsp of fat per day through cooking. \\n2.4  Classification of Proteins \\nWe know that proteins are essential for maintaining and sustaining life. Proteins contain carbon, hydrogen, nitro gen, \\nsulphur and some also contain phosphorus. Proteins are chains of amino acids held together by peptid e bonds, only about \\n20 different amino acids are used but the number of ways in which they can be arranged is almost infinite. It is the specific \\nand unique sequence of these units which gives each protein its characteristic structural and enzyma tic properties. Let us \\nconsider the two very familiar protein s. One of them is the egg white protein, which is very sensitive. It denatures on \\nheating, dissolves easily in water and is quite reactive, while the other one is keratin of nails an d hoofs, is wholly insoluble, \\ntough and chemically inert and resistant. He nce, it is not easy to classify proteins. Besides classifying proteins on the basis \\nof soluble and insoluble, proteins have been further classified based on the following attributes:'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='30 \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Classification based on chemical nature \\ni) Simple proteins (albumin, globulin, glutelin, prolamin, fibrous protein, histones) \\nii) Conjugated proteins ( glycoproteins, lipoproteins, nucleoproteins) \\niii) Derived proteins (metaproteins, coagulated proteins, proteoses, peptones, peptides) \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Classification based on chemical properties \\ni) Monoamino mono carboxylic acids \\nii) Mono amino dicarboxylic acids \\niii) Diamino mono carboxylic acids \\niv) Sulphur containing amino acids \\nv) Aromatic and heterocyclic amino acids \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Classification based on amino acid content \\ni) Essential (indispensable) \\nii) Conditionally essential \\niii) Non essential (dispensable) \\n \\n2.4.1  Amino acids \\nAs we have already discussed proteins are made of amino acids. These amino acids can be broadly divi ded into two types: \\nessential and non essential. Essential amino acids cannot be made in the body at least in amounts sufficient for health and \\nmust therefore be present in the food. Non essential amino acids are equally necessary but they diff er in that it is possible  \\nfor them to be made from any excess of certain amino acids in the diet.  \\nThe 8 amino acids essential for adults are: \\nIsoleucine phenylalanine leucine methionine \\nThreonine tryptophan  valine  lysine \\nAnd another amino acid histidine is also essential for infants. \\nThe remaining amino acids which are widespread in proteins are: \\n  Alanine arginine aspartic acid cysteine glutamic acid \\n  Glycine proline serine  tyrosine \\n Refer to table no.2.4.1 for classification of amino acids. \\n2.4.2  Sources and function of proteins  \\nThe important sources of proteins in the diets of low -income groups are cereals and legumes but t he overall proportion of \\namino acids in any single vegetable food differ from those needed by man. These proteins are therefore known to have low \\nbiological value.Most animal proteins like meat, fish, eggs and milk are important sources of proteins and have high \\nbiological value. Oilseeds, oilseed meals and soy are also rich sources of proteins. Because there isno way in which excesses \\nof amino acids can be stored in the body, they can be most efficiently used if a complete assortment  is supplied to the \\nbody.this can be achieved by eating a mixed diet. Mixture of animal and vegetable protein like cerea ls with milk, bread and \\ncheese, fish and chips etc provide a sound physiological basis. \\nRefer to table no.2.4.2 for protein content of some important foods. \\nEach of the various proteins in the body serves a specific function in the maintenance of life. Any loss in body protein, in \\nreality, means a loss in cellular function. In contrast to lipids and carbohydrates, proteins have n o true body reserve. \\nHumans when deprived of or insufficiently supplied with protein, compensate for this dietary deficiency by ca tabolizing'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"31 \\n \\nsome, but not all, of their tissue functionality. Cells, tissues, organs and whole systems cannot exist without proteins serving \\ntheir various functions. \\nSo let us get to know the varied functions of proteins in our body. \\no Bodybuilding functions of proteins : The primary functions of proteins are tissue growth and maintenance. \\nProtein contains amino acids - the building blocks -t hat our bodies use to  build and maintain muscles, bone, \\nskin, blood and other organs. Thus, proteins play an important role in growth and body-building. \\no Protein as an energy source : If diet does not furnish enough calories from carbohydrates and fats, proteins \\ncontribute to th e body's energy need by catabolizing. One gram protein yields 4 Kcal. But it is important to \\nunderstand that this is not the major function of proteins. This only happens when the diet does not supply \\nenough energy-giving nutrients. \\no Proteins as enzymes:  From conception to death, living cells use oxygen and metabolize fuel. Cells synthesize \\nnew products, degrade others, and generally are in a state of metabolic flux. For these processes to  occur, \\ncatalysts are needed .These catalysts called 'enzymes' are p roteins. Enzymes are the largest and the most \\nspecialized class of proteins. Each enzyme is unique and catalyzes a specific kind of reaction. In t he cell, \\nenzymes are found in cellular compartments (cytoplasm, nucleus, mitochondria, etc.), as well as, the  \\nmembranes within and around the cell wall. The location of an enzyme is one of its characteristics a nd \\ndictates, in part, its role in metabolism. \\no Proteins as carriers: A large variety of compounds are carried in the blood between tissues and organs of the \\nbody. Some of the compounds require specific protein for their transport. Not only is this specific protein \\nnecessary for the transport of compounds insoluble in blood, but it is also necessary to protect the se \\ncompounds from further reactions that take place during the transport process. \\no Proteins as regulators of water balance : As substrates and solutes are transferred or exchanged across \\nmembranes, water has a tendency to flow to maintain equal osmotic pressure on each side of the membr ane. \\nIf osmotic pre ssure is not maintained, the individual cells either shrink from lack of internal water or burst \\nfrom too much.  Albumin plays a significant role in maintaining the osmotic pressure because of its size and \\nabundance.The protein hormone particularly the Anti -Diuretic Hormone (ADH) plays a role in controlling \\nwater balance. The effect of protein is on the distribution of water amongst the various body compar tments \\nthan on the total body water. \\no Proteins as biological buffers:  Proteins have the ability to accept  or donate hydrogen ions and by doing so \\nthey serve as biological buffers. In blood, there are three important buffering systems - plasma proteins, \\nhemoglobin and carbonic acid bicarbonate. \\no Proteins as structural elements and structural units: Proteins function as enzymes, carriers, binding or \\nreceptor sites or entry ports for a large variety of materials binding, entering or leaving the cell . Thus proteins \\nserve as the structural and functional units of the cell membrane. Proteins are also important int racellular \\nstnictural units. The most important structural function of protein is related Lo skin and connective tissue. The \\nskin is composed of epithelial tissue which covers not only the exterior of the body but also lines the \\ngastrointestinal tract, res piratory tract and the urinary tract. One of the major protein found in the skin is \\n'melanin'. Collagen and elastin are the two distinct types of proteins in the connective tissue. Muscle is \\ncomposed of 20% protein, 75% water and 5% inorganic material, glycogen and other organic compounds. The \\nmajor proteins in muscle are myosin - a large globular protein, and actin – a smaller globular protein. \\no Proteins as lubricants : Tbe mucous of the respiratory tract, oral cavity, vaginal tract and the rectal cavity \\nreduces the irritation which might be caused by materials moving through these passages. This mucous is  a \\nmucoprotein, a conjugated protein which contains hexosamine.. Proteins as lubricants also surround the joints \\nand facilitate their movement. \\no Proteins in the immune system :: Proteins such as y -globulin serve to protect the body against foreign cells. \\nThe immunoglobulins produced by lymphocytes are large polypeptides having more than one basic \\nmonomeric unit. \\n \\n2.4.3  Nutritional requirement of proteins and health aspects \\nThe FAO/WHO Committee (1973) expressed the protein requirements in terms of egg or milk proteins. Th e committee \\ndefined safe level of protein intake as 'the amount necessary to meet the physiological needs and maintain the health of  \\nnearly all the individuals in a specified age/sex group. The term protein requirement means that amount of protein which \\nmust be consumed to provide the amino acids for the synthesis of those body proteins irreversibly\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"32 \\n \\ncatabolized in the course of the body’s metabolism'. The intake of nitrogen from protein must be sufficient to balance that \\nexcreted; this basic concept is called nitrogen balance. This concept is useful in understanding the minimal need for protein \\nin the diet. \\nProtein requirement is greatly influenced by many factors such as age, environmental temperature, energy intake, gender, \\nmicronutrient intake, infection, activity, previous diet, trauma, pregnancy and lactation. Let us take up each of these factors \\nin detail. \\n\\uf0b7 Age: Protein in excess of maintenance needs is required, when a new tissue is being formed. Certain age periods, when \\ngrowth is rapid, require more dietary protein than other periods.Full term infants have indicated th at a protein intake \\nof 2.0 to 2.5g/ kg/day is needed for satisfacto ry weight gain whereas older infants and children, whose growth rate is \\nnot as rapid as the premature or new born infant, require considerably less protein (1.25g/kg/day). As growth rate \\nincreases during adolescence, the protein needs increase. As the huma n completes his growth, the need for protein \\ndecreases until it arrives at a level which is called the 'maintenance level'. It is at this level that the concept of body \\nprotein replacement by dietary protein applies. \\n\\uf0b7 Environmental temperature : As environmental temperatures rise or fall above or below the range of thermic \\nneutrality; animals begin to increase their caloric expenditure to maintain their body temperature. An increase in \\nenergy needs is accompanied by an increase in the protein requirement for maintenance. In addition, nitrogen is lost \\nduring profuse sweating that occurs in very warm environments which accounts for more protein intake in diet. \\n\\uf0b7 Previous diet:  The effects of previous diet in the determination of protein requirements is quite profo und. \\nMalnourished people have a higher protein requirement than well -nourished people. Every protein in the body has a \\nfunction and if some of these proteins are lost, there is a loss in body function. Support for this concept is seen in the \\nreduced ability of protein depleted animals to fight infection or respond to the metabolic effects of trauma. \\n\\uf0b7 Physical activity:  In a number of studies, the athletic performance of subjects could not be directly related to the \\nquantity of protein consumed above the mini mum requirement unlike a popular fad that that heavy muscular work \\nrequired a heavy protein diet.  Generally as the energy requirement is increased to support the increase in muscular \\nactivity, so too is the protein requirement in much the same manner as de scribed above for the effects of rise in body \\ntemperature. \\nAs can be anticipated, males due to their greater physical activity and larger body size have a larg er protein requirement \\nthan females. Pregnancy, lactation and trauma increase the protein require ments. So, now you realize that a large number \\nof factors play a role in determination of protein requirement. \\nRefer to table no. 2.4.3 for nutritional requirements of protein for Indians in different age groups and physiological stages \\nas suggested by the ICMR.  \\nProteins apart from growth, repair and maintenance also lend a hand in providing energy, if such a situation arises. Excesses \\nof amino acids are converted into glucose in the liver or directly oxidized to provide heat and ener gy. So proteins can be a \\nsource of energy, if required.  \\n \\nNewborn infants can absorb proteins intact from their mother’s milk, including antibodies that provi de protection from \\ninfection. On the other hand, there are individuals who are susceptible to reaction with certain other proteins for ex. Those \\nwith celiac disease react to gluten and some to cow’s milk protein. In addition, some beans like raj mah and soya beans \\ncontain proteins, which are harmful unless well cooked.  \\n \\nDeficiency of protein is one of the most common nutritional di sorders in the world today and affects both adults and \\nchildren especially in less developed nations.The symptoms vary and in many situations, it is diffic ult to separate protein \\ndeficiency from energy deficit. In children, one may observe the different sy mptoms and visualize them all as parts of a \\ncontinuum called protein -energy or protein calorie malnutrition (PEM or PCM) rather than distinctly different nutritional \\ndisorders. \\n2.5  Let us sum up \\nWe studied about carbohydrates, its functions and types. We learnt that carbohydrates provide energy  (4 cal/g). They are \\nformed plants in bewildering array of possible single unit and polymer structures. Humans have the a bility to digest only a \\nfew of the many possible bonds linking carbohydrate units with each other and with other types of organic molec ules. \\nAbout 80% of edible carbohydrates are absorbed as single glucose unit and metabolized.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"33 \\n \\nFor optimum function of nervous system and cells, blood glucose concentrations are tightly controlled by hormones (insulin \\nin the absorptive phase; glucagon, adrenaline and cortisol in the post absorptive phase) utilizing s everal possible metabolic \\npathways for glucose anabolism and catabolism. \\nDepending on the struc ture, non-digestible carbohydrates pass into the colon. They are fermented in varying degrees to \\nshort-chain fatty acids, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane in the large bowel. Absorbed short chain fat ty acids are \\nmetabolized in colonic epithelial, hepatic and muscle cells. Thus, these perform a number of beneficial functions. \\nIntakes of optimum amounts of different types of carbohydrates are associated with good health through effects on energy \\nbalance, digestive function, blood glucose control and other risk factors for several chronic diseases. \\n We learnt about the classification of fats, the major difference between fats and oils and the concept of visible and invisible \\nfats. We generally consume fats in the form of triglycerides. Our diets also provid e cholesterol, which is present only in \\nfoods of animal origin. \\nWe then learnt about lipid digestion and absorption, where we discussed that long  chain fatty acids, cholesterol and \\nphospholipids are absorbed through the lymphatic vessels after emulsificati on by bile. Short and medium chain fatty acids \\nare absorbed directly into blood. We also got to know about '.good' and 'bad' cholesterol. \\nThe good cholesterol or HDL is cardio -protective and can be raised by exercise, avoidance of smoking, maintaining norm al \\nweight and eating pattern, Fats have an important role in human nutrition and some amount of it should be present in daily \\ndiet. Use of 2-3 different oils while cooking is good for health. Eating out or eating prepackaged or fast foods  o ften should \\nbe avoided as it leads to an increase in consumption of fats especially trans-fatty acids. \\nWe also learnt that excessive fat intake could lead to major health diseases such as obesity, heart diseases and cancer. \\nHence, a judicious fat intake with a healthy lifestyle and correct eating habits like consumption of fruits and vegetables that \\ninhibit LDL oxidation must be chosen to prevent the risk of these diseases.  \\nWe learnt that proteins are vital to all body cells, tissues, organs and functions of organ system s. The process of digestion, \\nabsorption and metabolism of protein are complex and involve several nutritional and non -nutritional factors. Proteins are \\nwidely distributed in nature, the richest vegetarian source being soybeans. Egg protein has the highest biologic value.  \\nSeveral methods can be employed to determine the protein content of foods, the most popular being th ose based on \\ngrowth and body weight changes. Protein quality in the diet can be improved by mutual supplementatio n of protein rich \\nfoods and cereals. Nutritional requirements of proteins vary with age and physiological activity. Deficiency of proteins leads \\nto the twin disorders of marasmus and kwashiorkor and can be cured by dietary intervention. \\n2.6  Glossary \\n \\nWORDS MEANINGS \\nCARBOHYDRATES \\nDiverticular disease \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\na condition in which small pouches called diverticulae, \\ndevelop at the weak spots in the wall of the colon, that \\neventually bulge out to form pouches  the integral proteins \\nwhich penetrate and span the lipid bilayer of plasma \\nmembrane. \\na product of average glycemic index total  carbohydrate \\nintake. \\nalso called as piles; these are th e small troublesome \\ntumors or swellings with a painful mass of dilate veins in\"),\n",

As the name sug gests it means that \\nthese two categories of nutrients in food protect the body from diseases and infections and also hel p it to function \\noptimally. \\nVitamins are the organic substances  that act as coenzyme and/or regulator of metabolic processes. There are 13 known \\nvitamins, most of which are present in foods while some are produced within the body. Depending on t he property of \\nsolubility, vitamins are divided into two groups, namely, water-soluble and fat-soluble.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='42 \\n \\nWater-soluble vitamins include vitamin B-complex, which is a group of B Vitamins, and vitamin C or ascorbic acid while the \\nfat-soluble vitamins comprise of 4 vitamins - A, D, E and K. Fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K, are termed so because they \\nare found in nature in close association with fatty foods such as butter, cream, vegetable oils, mea t, poultry and fish and \\ntheir products. While fat-soluble vitamins -Vitamin A, D, E and K - dissolve in fat before they are absorbed in the blood \\nstream to carry out their functions, water-soluble vitamins i.e. B-complex group and vitamin C dissolve in water.  \\nExcesses of fat soluble vitamins are stored in the liver whereas water soluble vitamins are not stor ed; hence a continuous \\nsupply of them is required in our diets.  \\nMinerals are required by humans for optimal functioning. Most minerals can be detected in the body and only 1 5 of them \\nare known to be essential and must be derived from food. These mineral elem ents are broadly divided into two classes i.e. \\nmacro and micro minerals.  \\nMacro minerals, also referred to as major minerals are distinguished from micro minerals by their occurrence in the body. \\nWhile macro minerals constitute at least 0.01% of the total body weight or at least  5 g in a 60 kg body i.e. they are required \\nin amounts greater than 100 mg per day whereas on the other hand, requirement of micro minerals vari es from a only few \\nmilligrams to micrograms per day. \\nMacro minerals are Calcium, phospho rus, magnesium, sodium, potassium and chloride and micro minerals are iron, zinc, \\ncopper, selenium, chromium, manganese, iodine and fluorine. \\n3.2      Classification of Vitamins, their sources, digestion, absorption, functions and nutritional requirements \\nWe shall discuss about vitamins first and then move onto minerals. Vitamins are classified as water-soluble and fat-soluble \\nvitamins depending on their solubility. Fat-soluble vitamins -vitamin A, D, E and K dissolve in fat before they are absorbed in \\nthe blood stream to carry out their functions. Excesses of these vitamins are stored in the liver. Becau se they are stored, \\nthey are not needed every day in the diet. By contrast, water -soluble vitamins dissolve in water and are not stored. They \\nare eliminated in urine. We need a continuous supply of them in our diets. The water -soluble vitamins are the B -complex \\ngroup and vitamin C. \\n3.2.1  Vitamin A \\nThe chemical name of vitamin A is retinol. Retinol is referred to as pre-formed vitamin A, as it is present in f oods already in \\nthe active form and does not require any conversion. Retinol itself is found only in animal foods but milk and some \\nvegetable foods also contain the deep yellow or orange carotenes which can be converted in the body to retinol and are \\ntherefore sources of vitamin A activity. The most important of these is beta carotene which is the  primary and most \\nefficient pro vitamin A or carotenoid. \\n\\uf0b7 Sources:  Vitamin A or retinol is  found only in foods of animal origin, such as milk, cheese, cream, butter, ghee, egg, fish, \\nkidney and liver, liver oils of fish such as halibut, cod and shark. Provitamin A (so called because it is a precursor and has to \\nbe chemically transformed into re tinal) or B -carotene is found primarily in plant foods, which contain orange or yellow -\\ncolored pigments called carotenoids. B-carotene is the most widely distributed carotenoid in plant foods. Palm fruit and red \\npalm oil are the richest source of beta-carotene and dark green leafy vegetables, ripe fruits such as mango, papaya, apricots \\nand yellow orange vegetables like carrot, pumpkin and sweet potato are rich in B carotene. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Functions: Vitamin A (retinol) is an essential nutrient needed in small amounts by humans for the normal functioning of the \\nvisual system, growth and development, and maintenance of epithelial cellular integrity, immune func tion, and \\nreproduction. \\n1. Vitamin A deficiency is the leading cause of preventable severe visual impairment and blindness, and the most \\nvulnerable are preschool children and pregnant women, particularly in our country. It is ironical th at a small \\namount of less than 10 gm of green leaves can meet the day’s requirement of vitamin A of preschool children. \\nYet an estimated  250,000 to 500,000 VAD children world over become blind every year, and about half of \\nthem die within a year. Administration of large doses of vitamin A to children at -risk has been the most \\npopular approach to control nutritional blindness. \\nThe next function of great significance is the role of vitamin A in differentiation of cells.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"43 \\n \\n2. Role in growth and cellular differentiation : The growth and differentiation of epithelial cells throughout the \\nbody are especially affected by vitamin A deficiency. In additio n, goblet cell numbers are reduced in epithelial \\ntissues and as a consequence, mucous secretions diminish. Cells lining protective tissue surfaces fail to \\nregenerate and differentiate; hence they flatten and accumulate keratin. Xerosis and xerophthalmia a re such \\ndiseases due to deficiency of vitamin A. \\n3. Role in immune response:  Cells lining protective tissue surfaces fail to regenerate and differentiate; hence \\nthey flatten and accumulate keratin.Both factors - the decline in mucous secretions and loss of cel lular \\nintegrity reduce the body's ability to resist invasion from potentially pathogenic organisms. Pathogens can also \\ncompromise the immune system by directly interfering with the production  of some types of protective \\nsecretions and cells. \\n4. Integrity of e pithelial tissues: Vitamin A is essential for the integrity of the mucous -secreting cells. In fact, \\nvitamin A maintains the health of epithelial cells that line internal and external surfaces of the l ungs, \\nintestines, stomach, vagina, urinary tract and bla dder, eyes and skin. These cells act as important barriers to \\nbacteria. Certain epithelial cells secrete mucous to keep the skin, eyes and other mucous membranes moist. In \\ndeficiency, the epithelial tissues are keratinized. The tissues affected are salivar y glands, respiratory tract, \\neyes, skin and sex organs. \\n5. Role as antioxidant:  vitamin A and related nutrients may collectively be important in protecting against \\nconditions related to oxidative stress, such as aging, air pollution, arthritis, cancer, cardio vascular disease, \\ncataracts, diabetes mellitus and infection. Antioxidants protect our cells against the effects of free radicals, are \\npotentially damaging compounds produced as by -products of metabolism, as well as, through exposure to \\ntoxins and pollutants (e.g. smoking). \\n6. Bones and nerves ::T he role of vitamin A in bone formation and the association of its deficiency with the \\ndegeneration of myelin sheath is currently being explored. \\n7. Role in protein metabolism and growth: Severe vitamin A deficiency results in abnormal RNA metabolism and \\nprotein synthesis and hence interferes with growth. Hence vitamin A is also called growth vitamin. \\n8. Role in the synthesis of mucoproteins and macro polysaccharides:  Vitamin A  is vital for the synthesis of \\nmucoproteins  and glycoproteins and incorporation of inorganic sulphate in mucopolysachharides and their \\nsynthesis. \\n9. Role in reproduction : Deficiency of Vitamin A  leads to infertility in the male and failure of' thc female to \\nconceive or resorption or abortion of the fetus, chiefly in animals. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Nutritional requirement and RDA for Vitamin A \\nThe RDA suggested for vitamin A is given in Table 7.l (a). You can observe from the values given in the table that the \\nrequirements are highest during lactation. This is due to the fact that human milk, particularly colostrum is a rich source of \\nvitamin A. It is also evident that the intake recommended for pre -schoolers and older children are equal to that \\nrecommended for adult man and woman. This high level has been suggested keeping in mind the high prevalence rate of \\nclinical vitamin A deficiency in this segment of the population. The recommendations have been based  on the fact that \\nwhat level of vitamin A is required to prevent deficiency and also maintain health. In calculating t he sa fe intake, a \\nnormative storage requirement equivalent to 434 mg RE/day was taken into consideration as anything m ore than that \\ncould also lead to toxicity. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects \\n \\nDeficiency:  \\nVitamin A deficiency (VAD), as you already know, leads to impairment in  the vision, severe infections and even death. It \\nencompasses the full spectrum of clinical consequences associated with sub optimal vitamin A status.  These disorders are \\nknown to include reduced immune competence resulting in increased morbidity and morta lity (largely from increased \\nseverity of infectious diseases), night blindness, corneal ulcers, keratomalacia and related ocular signs and symptoms of \\nxerophthalmia; exacerbation of anemia through sub optimal absorption and utilization of iron and oth er conditions not yet \\nfully identified or clarified (e.g. retardation of growth and development).  \\nToxicity \\nBecause vitamin A is fat-soluble and can be stored, primarily in the liver, routine consumption of large amounts of vitamin A \\nover a period of time can r esult in toxic symptoms, including liver damage, bone abnormalities and joint pain, alopecia, \\nheadaches, vomiting and skin desquamation. In fact, symptoms that occur due to intakes in excess of those recommended \\nover a prolonged period are referred to as symptoms of hypervitaminosis.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='44 \\n \\n3.2.2  Vitamin B complex  \\nThe major group of water-soluble vitamins is the B-complex group of vitamins. Examples include thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, \\npyridoxin, folic acid, cyanocobalamin etc. Although the chemical structure of  each is quite different, and they have several \\nfeatures in common. They act as “co -factors” in different enzyme systems in the body; they tend to occur in the same \\nfoods; and being water soluble, they are not stored for long in the body. These characteris tics mean that diets containing \\ntoo little B-vitamins can lead to multiple deficiency diseases within a few months. \\n3.2.3  Thiamin (vitamin B1 or Aneurin) \\nThiamin is one of the earliest recognized vitamins. It is necessary for the steady and continuous release of energy from \\ncarbohydrate. Thiamin requirements are thus related to the amount of carbohydrate and more or less t o the amount of \\nenergy in the diet. \\n\\uf0b7 Sources: It is widely distributed in both animal and vegetable foods. \\nRich sources :  Rice polishings, wheat germ, dried yeast, yeast extract. \\nGood sources:  Whole cereals, whole wheat, millets, raw and hand -pounded or parboiled rice, pulses, soya \\nbean, dried beans, oilseeds and nuts. \\nFair sources:  Meat, fish, eggs, milk, vegetables and fruits. \\nIt is to be noted that cooking may result in considerable losses from these foods. Fats, sugars and alcoho lic drinks contain \\nno thiamin at all. It is depleted by use of coffee, tannin from black teas, nicotine and alcohol. \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and elimination: After a meal, thiamin is found in the intestine in the free form. Its absorption involves \\ntwo mechanisms- both active and passive. It is absorbed primarily from the upper jejunum by diffusion and by an acti ve \\ntransport mechanism but can also occur in the du odenum and ileum. After absorption, only a small part passes into \\ncirculation as free thiamin while a greater part is converted into thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) in the liver and intestinal \\nmucosa. A small quantity of thiamin is also converted into thiamin triphosphate (TTP).It is then excreted in urine. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Functions of Thiamine:  \\nThiamin has a key metabolic role in the cellular production of energy; mainly in glucose metabolism i.e. it helps the body \\ncells convert carbohydrates into energy. Thiamin is also es sential for the functioning of the heart, muscles, and nervous \\nsystem. Other functions are:  \\n1. Regulator of enzyme activity: Thiamin regulates the enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. \\n2. Coenzyme in enzyme catalyzed reactions: Thiamin functions as the coenzyme thiamin pyrophosphate (TP?) in the \\nmetabolism of carbohydrates and branched chain amino acids. \\n3. TPP and TTP are vital for the nerves and cardiac tissues: TPP and TTP are inter convertible and are involved in \\ncarbohydrate metabolism. When there is insufficient thiamin, the overall decrease in carbohydrate metabolism \\nand its interconnection with amino acid metabolism has severe consequences, such as a decrease in the formation \\nof acetylcholine for neural function. Thus, deficiency in the tissues affects energy metabolism in nervous tissue and \\ncardiac muscle. \\n4. Role in the conversion carbohydrates to fats: Thiamin helps in the initial steps of fatty acid and sterol production. \\nIn this way, thiamin also helps convert carbohydrate to fat for storage of potential energy. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Recommended Dietary Allowance: As thiamin facilitates energy utilization, its requirements have been expressed on the \\nbasis of energy intake, which can vary depending on activity levels. Therefore, the RDA recommendation by ICMR for adults \\nis 0.5 mg per 1000 Kcal, or an intake of at least than 1 mg per day is advised. The individual intak e for thiamin, for an adult \\nman is 1.2 mg per day and adult woman is 0.9 mg per day.'),\n",

The early clinical features are anorexia and dyspepsia, associated with heaviness  and weakness of the \\nlegs. There is tenderness of the calf muscles on pressure with complaints of \\'pins and needles\\' pain  and numbness in the \\nlegs. The pers on feels weak and get easily exhausted while working. If not treated, he or she may develop polyneuritic \\nberiberi, that is, inflammation of many or all of the peripheral nerves. A detail discussion on the different forms of beriberi \\nfollows: \\nWet beriberi: Edema is the important feature of wet beriberi. It may develop rapidly and involve not only the legs  but also \\nthe face, trunk and serous cavities. Palpitation and breathlessness are present. The calf muscles ar e frequently tense, \\nslightly swollen and tender on pressure. \\nDry beriberi: Early symptoms are similar to those found in wet beriberi. The muscles become progressively wasted a nd \\nweak and walking becomes difficult. \\nInfantile beriberi: Infantile beriberi is commonly seen in many South-East Asian countries where the diets consist mostly of \\n\"polished rice\" and are deficient in thiamin. \\nToxicity: \\nThiamin toxicity is not a problem because renal clearance of the vitamin is rapid. Since the body st ores of thiamin are very \\nlow, we must ensure adequate daily intake. \\n3.2.4 Riboflavin (vitamin B2) \\nRiboflavin was discovered in milk  as a pigment possessing a bright yellow green color and is essential for the utilization of \\nenergy from food. Although it is widely distributed in foods, especially animal foods, about one third of intake comes from \\none source i.e. milk. Riboflavin is destroyed by ultraviolet rays hence exposure of milk to sunlight is not advised. \\n\\uf0b7 Sources:  The food sources of riboflavin include: \\n Rich sources: Liver, dried yeast, egg powder, milk powder. \\nGood sources: Whole cereals, millets, pulses, green leafy vegetables, oilseeds and nuts, meat, fish, eggs and milk. \\nFair sources:  Milled cereals and cereal products, roots and tubers, other vegetables and fruits. \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and elimination: Riboflavin is absorbed from the small intestine through the portal vein and is passed \\nto all tissues via general circulation. Absorption occurs in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract by specialized \\ntransport. Riboflavin is also synthesized by intestinal bacteria and then absorbed by the colon. Riboflavin is not stored in the \\nbody. A major part is excreted in urine and the rest is broken down in the tissues. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Functions of Riboflavin:  Riboflavin plays an important role in human metabolic processes and in maintaining good health. \\n1. Precursor of co-enzymes: The major function of\\' riboflavin is to serve as the precursor of the coenzymes FMN \\n(flavin mononzicleotide ) and FAD ( flavinadenine dinucleotide and of\\' the covalently bound flavins. \\n2. Role in respiratory clzailz : The flavocoenzymes (FMN aud FAD) participate in oxidation -reduction reactions in \\nmetabolic pathways and in energy production via the respiratory chain. \\n3. Drug and lipid metabolism: Flavoproteins catalyze dehydrogenation reactions,as well as, hydroxylations, oxidative \\ndecarobxylations, deoxygenatio~ls and reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. \\n4. Antioxidant activity: Flavoproteins also have powerful antioxidant activity from their role as precursors to FMN \\nand FAD. \\n5. Protective role:  Riboflavin protects the octodei~nalt issues and prevents lesioils of the skin, eye and nervous \\nsystem. Riboflavin ameliorates cardiac damage and also has anti malarial effects. \\n6. Regulatory functions: Riboflavin helps with the regulatory functions of some hormones  involved in carbohydrate \\nmetabolism. \\n7. Other functions: Riboflavin interrelates with ocher B vitamins, notably niacin, which requires FAD for its formation \\nfrom tryptophan, and vitamin B6 which requires FMN for conversion.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='46 \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Recommended Dietary Allowance: Several nutritional and physiological factors govern riboflavin requirements. Negative \\nnitrogen balance reduces riboflavin requirements and excretion. Physical activity reduces urinary ri boflavin excretion. \\nHence, the dietary requirement is increased by ex ercise and increased physical activity. Therefore, the RDA for individual \\nintake follows the similar pattern as for thiamin. RDI for riboflavin for adults are 0.6 mg/ 1000 Kc al, i.e. for adult males, the \\nrequirements are 1.4 mg/day while for adult females,  it is 1.1 mg per day and increase up to 1.3 - 1.4 mg per day during \\npregnancy and lactation. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects:  \\nDeficiency: \\nDeficiency of Riboflavin results in the condition of hypo- or aribc?flavi~iosisw, ith sore throat, hyperaemia (condition in \\nwhich the blood collects in a part of the body), oederna of the pharyngeal and oral mucous membranes, cheilosi s (cracking \\nof the corner of the mouth), angular stomatitis (inflammation at the corner of the mouth), glossitis  (inflammation or the \\ninfection of the tongu e), seborrheic dermatitis and normochromic, normocytic anaemia associated with pure red cell \\ncytoplasia of the bone marrow. As riboflavin deficiency almost invariably occurs in combination with a deficiency of other B-\\ncomplex vitamins, some of the symptoms (e.g. glossitis and dermatitis) may result from other complicating deficiencies. The \\nmajor cause of hyporiboflavinosis is inadequate dietary intake as a result of limited food supply, which is sometiines \\nexacerbated by poor food storage or processing. Children in developing countries demonstrate clinical signs of riboflavin \\ndeficiency during periods when gastrointestinal infections are prevalent.  Soine cases of riboflavin deficiency have been \\nobserved in south-east Asian school children infected with hookworm. \\nToxicity \\nRiboflavin toxicity is not a problem because of the limited intestinal absorption of this vitamin. \\n3.2.5 Niacin \\nNicotinic acid and nicotinamide are two forms of another B -vitamin (known collectively as niacin) which is involved in the \\nutilization of food energy. Nicotinaimide is required for the synthesis of the active forms of niacin i.e NAD and its phosphate \\nwhich functions as a cofactor for various coenzymes in our body. Nicotinic acid was first isolated f rom rice polishing and \\nshown to be a component of coenzyme I and II and several transporting enzymes in the tissues. \\n\\uf0b7 Food sources of Niacin \\nNiacin is widely distributed in plant and animal foods mainly as the pyridine nucleotides NAD and NA DP. The food sources \\nof niacin are highlighted herewith: \\nRich sources: Dried yeast, rice polishings, peanuts, liver. \\nGood sources: Whole cereals legumes, meat and fish. \\nFair sources: Milled cereals, maize, roots and tubers, vegetables, milk, eggs. \\nWhole cereals are good sources of niacin, but the removal of the bran in the milling of wheat reduces the niacin content of \\nwhite wheat flour to a low level. Niacin is readily soluble in water, but is resistant to heat, oxidation and alkalis. It is, in fact, \\none of the most stable vitamins. \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and elimination : \\nNicotinic acid and nicotinamide are rapidly absorbed from the intestine rather than the stomach. NAD  and NADP, the main \\ndietary forms of niacin are hydrolyzed by enzymes in the intestinal mucosa to release nicotinamide. The intestinal mucosa is \\nrich in niacin conversion enzymes such as glycohydrolase. Niacin is methylated in the liver and excr eted in the urine along \\nwith oxidation products. The pattern of niacin products excreted depends on the amount and the form of niacin ingested \\nand the niacin status of the individual. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions of  Niacin :   \\n1) Protective role: Nicotinic acid is vital to the normal functioning of the skin, intestinal tract and nervous system. \\nIt protects the tissues from pellagraic lesions. \\n2) Coenzyme activity: NAD is required for transfer reactions involved in DNA repair and calcium mobilization. \\nNAD functions in intracellular respiration and with enzymes involved in the oxidation of fuel substrate. \\n3) Metal chelating ability : This explains its biological interactions  with essential trace metals. It is a part of the \\nproposed glucose tolerance factor, an organo chromium complex that may potentiate insulin response in man.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"47 \\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Recommended Dietary Allowance: \\nThere are various factors an which niacin requirements depend. Thes e are energy utilization, body size and dietary \\ntryptophan. The efficiency of conversion of tryptophan to niacin is affected by various factors incl uding the amount of \\ntryptophan and niacin ingested protein and energy intake, as well as, vitamin B6 and B2 status. ICMR recommended RDI for \\nindividual intake of niacin as niacin equivalents (NE) for adult is 6.6 mg per 1000 Kcal. For a sede ntary male and sedentary \\nfemale it is 16 and 12 mg per day, respectively. With pregnancy and lactation, the RDA increases t o about 14 - 16 mg per \\nday. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects: \\nDeficiency: \\nThe disease is characterized by 3 D's- dermatitis, diarrhoea and dementia. Niacin (nicotinic acid) deficiency classically results \\nin pellagra which is a chronic wasting disease associated with a characteristic erythematous dermatitis,a dementia after \\nmental changes including insomnia and apathy preceding an overt encephalopathy, and diarrhea resulti ng from \\ninflammation of the intestinal mucous surfaces. \\nToxicity \\nAlthough therapeutically useful in lowering serum cholesterol, administration of chronic high oral doses of nicotinic acid can \\nlead to hepatotoxicity, as well as, dermatologic manifestations. \\n3.2.6 B6 (pyridoxine) \\nVitamin B6 or pyridoxine is involved in the metabolism of amino acids includi ng the conversion of tryptophan to nicotinic \\nacid; the requirements are thus related to the protein content of the diet. Pyridoxine or vitamin B6 is one of the B complex \\nvitamins which prevents and cures dermatitis in rats fed on vitamin B6 deficient diets. \\n\\uf0b7 Food sources of pyridoxine: \\nVitamin B6 occurs widely in food, especially in meats and fish, eggs, whole cereals and some vegetab les. The main sources \\nin the diet are potatoes and other vegetables, milk and meat. \\nRaw foods contain more of this vitamin than cooked foods. The food sources include: \\nRich sources: Rice polishings, wheat bran, wheat germ, dried yeast, liver. \\nGood sources: Whole cereals, legumes, nuts and seeds, milk powder, meat, egg, leafy vegetables. \\nFair sources: Milled cereals, vegetables and fruits. \\nLong storage, canning, roasting or stewing of meat, food -processing techniques, use of alcohol are destructive to this \\nvitamin. \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and elimination: \\nAbsorption occurs primarily in the intestine (jejunum) by passive di ffusion. The vitamin is transported in blood both in \\nplasma and in red cells, mainly bound to aIbumin in plasma and hemoglobin in erythrocytes. Eighty percent of vitamin B6 is \\npresent in muscle. Excretion is through the urinary pathway. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions of  Pyridoxines:   \\n1. Formation of amines: Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxamine phosphate (PMP) are vital for the formation of \\nseveral amines that are functional in nervous tissues, for the biosynthesis of haem, formation of sp hingolipids and \\nphosphorylation of glycogen. \\n2. Growth purposes: Pyridoqal5-phosphate (PLP) is essential for growth of infants and prevents degeneration of the \\nnerves. \\n3. Coenzyme activity: Pyridoxal phosphate acts as a coenzyme. \\n4. Muscle phosphorylase: Pyridoxal phosphate is a component of muscle phosphorylase. \\n5. Dehydrases: These enzymes are vital to the catabolism of threonine, seine and homoserine and contain \\npyridoxine. \\n6. Anti-atherosclerotic effect: Vitamin B6 deficiency precipitates hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosjs. \\n7. Immune bodies: Vitamin B6 deficiency is associated with impairment in both humoral and cell mediated immunity.  \\n8. Coenzyme A synthesis: Pyridoxine is involved in the synthesis of coenzyme A from pantothenic acid.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='48 \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Recommended Dietary Allowance:  \\nAverage requirements for pyridoxine vary with age, sex and physiological conditions such as protein status, pregnancy and \\nlactation. The ICMR recommendations for individual intake of pyridoxine for adult males and female, is 2.0 mg per day. \\nDuring pregnancy and lactation, the recommended level of intake is2.5 gm per day. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects: \\nDeficiency:  \\nDeficiency of vitamin B6 alone is uncommon because it usually occurs in association with a deficit i n other B -complex \\nvitamins. but women who are pregnant or taking oral contraceptives may benefi t from increased intakes of this vitamin. \\nInfants are especially susceptible to insufficient intakes, which can lead to epileptic form convuls ions. Skin changes include \\ndermatitis with cheilosis and glossitis. Moreover, there is usually a decrease in circu lating lymphocytes and sometimes \\nanaemia as well. \\nToxicity: \\nVery high intakes however are dangerous.  Though toxicity related to pyridoxine intake are rare, but use of high doses of \\npyridoxine for the treatment of pre-menstrual syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome (compression of the median nerve at the \\nwrist resulting in numbness, tingling, weakness in the hand and fingers), and some neurologic diseas es has resulted in \\nneurotoxicity. An upper limit (UL) of 100 mg per day has been adopted by the FAO/WHO 2004. \\n3.2.7 B12 (Cyanobalamin) \\nVitamin B12 is a mixture of several related compounds all of rich contain the trace element cobalt.  Vitamin B,, (cobalamin, \\ncbl) is a unique vitamin in human nutrition, since its malabsorption leads to the fatal syndrome of pernicious and \\nmegaloblastic anaemia with demyelinating lesions of the central nervous system. \\n\\uf0b7 Food Sources of cyanobalamin: \\nVitamin B I2 is unique among vitamins in the sense that it is mostly found in foods of animal origin  but is not generally \\npresent in plant products. \\nRich sources: Liver (goal, sheep, ox, pig). \\nGood sources: Meal, fish, egg, kidney, brain. \\nFair sources: Fresh milk, milk powder and cheese. \\nMost microorganisims including bacteria and algae, synthesize vitamin B12,a nd they constitute the o nly source of the \\nvitamin. The vitamin BI2 synthesized in microorganisms enters the human food chain through incorporation into food of \\nanimal origin. In ma ny, animals, gastrointestinal fermentation supports the growth of these vitamin B12 synthesizing \\nmicroorganisms, and subsequently the vitamin is absorbed and incorporated into the animal tissues. This is particularly true \\nfor the liver, where vitamin B,, is stored in large concentrations. Products from herbivorous animals, such as milk, meat and \\neggs, thus constitute important dietary sources of the vitamin. Humans, therefore, derive dietary Vi tamin B12 almost \\nexclusively from animal tissues or products (i.e. milk, butter, cheese, eggs, meal, poultry). \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and elimination: \\nVitamin B12 in food is bound to proteins and is only released by the action of a high concentration of hydrochlo ric acid \\npresent in the stomach. Once released from foods, v itamin B12 absorption involves contact with two proteins: intrinsic \\nfactor (IF) and R-binder. Vitamin B12 is the only B vitamin our body can store. The average adult body contains 2 to 5 mg of \\nvitamin B12 with 80 percent of this stored in the liver.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"49 \\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Functions of   Vitamin B12 :   \\nThe functions of cyanocobalamin  are: \\n1. It  promotes the maturation of erythroid cells,  \\n2. It acts on other bone marrow elements and increases WBC and platelet count,  \\n3. It stimulates the appetite and general health of the subject,  \\n4. It cures neurological symptoms of pernicious anemia. It is involved in the manufacture of the myelin sheath, a fatty \\nlayer which insulates nerves,  \\n5. It is necessary for the production of nucleic acids, which make up DNA, the genetic  material of the cell,  \\n6. It functions as a coenzyme for enzymes methionine synthase and methybnalonyl coenzymze (CoA) mutase. \\n\\uf0b7 Recommended Dietary Allowance: \\nVitamin B12 deficiency is common in true vegans who can be treated with small doses since the daily requirement is only \\n1.0 g per day, recommendations for vitamin B12 for all age groups. However, the requirements do incr ease in lactation by \\n0.5 g per day.  \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects: \\nDeficiency: \\nBecause plants do not synthesize vitamin B 12, individuals who consume diets completely free of anim al products (vegan \\ndiets) are at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency. This is not true of lacto-ovo vegetarians, who consume the vitamin through eggs, \\nmilk and other dairy products. Persons living exclusively on vegetarian diets (vegans) have low seru m levels of vitamin B12 \\nand develop specific symptoms such as sore tongue, paraesthesia and signs of degeneration of the lon g tracts of the spinal \\ncord as a result of low intakes of vitamin B12. Megaloblastic anaemia is not so common when folic ac id intake is adequate. \\nThe anemia results from decreased DNA synthesis and failure of the cells to divide properly, coupled  with the continued \\nformation of RNA. \\nToxicity \\nIntake of 1000 pg vitamin B12 has never been reported to have any side -effects. Similar large amounts have been used in \\nsome preparations of nutritional supplements without apparent ill effects.  \\n3.2.8  Folic acid (Vitamin B9) \\nFolic acid or folate has several functions including its action with vitamin B12 in rapidly dividing cells . Folate is a generic \\nterm which includes naturally occurring food folate and folic acid in supplements and fortified food s. The term folk acid \\nrelates specifically to the fully oxidized monoglutamate form of the vitamin synthesized for commercial use in supplements \\nand fortified foods. \\n\\uf0b7 Food sources of folic acid: \\nFolate occurs naturally in foods. Although folate is found in a wide variety of foods, it is pr esent in a relatively low density \\nexcept in liver. Diets that contain adequate amounts of fresh green vegetables (i.e. in excess of tl vee servings per day) wil l \\nbe good folate sources. folate derived from animal products is subject to loss during cooking. Some staples, such as' white \\nrice are low in folate. \\nRich sources:  Liver, dried yeast, leafy vegetables, wheat germ and rice polishings. \\nGood sources:  Whole cereals, dried legumes (pulses have twice as much folic acid as cereals), nuts, fresh \\noranges, green leafy vegetables, \\n Fair sources:  Milled cereals, other vegetables, milk and fruits.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='50 \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and elimination: \\nFolic acid is readily absorbed from the small intestines througli the portal vein and passed onto th e tissues through general \\ncirculation. Following absorption, folic acid is largely reduced and methylated in the liver. Folate t ransport across \\nmembranes into cells in kidney, placenta and choroid plexus, occurs via membrane -associated folate binding proteins that \\nact as folate receptors and facilitate cellular uptake of folate. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions of  Folic acid:   \\nFolate, also known as folic acid, is essential for good health. Its functions are: \\n1. Folate is involved in the de novo synthesis of purines : synthesis of purines (adenine and guanine), requiring \\nthe folate form: Folate requiring reactions also  include those involved in phases of amino acid metabolism, \\n2. Folate specially helps in reducing the risk of heart disease  and stroke by lowering the level of the amino acid \\nhomocysteine in the blood (by forming methionine). \\n3. Folate is essential for the nervous system:  Myelin basic protein is methylated which acts as insulation for \\nnerve cells. When the methylation cycle is interrupted, as it is during vitainin B12 deficiency, one of the clinical \\nconsequences is the demyelinatioll of nerve cells resulting in a neuropathy which leads to ataxia (l ack of \\ncoordination), paralysis, and, if untreated, ultimately death. \\n4. Folate is also important for pregnant women.  Low blood levels of folate during pr egnancy can cause neural \\ntube defects-anencephaly (a defect in the closure of the neural tube) and spina bifida (a congenital defect in \\nwhich the spinal column is  imperfectly closed so that part of the meninges or spinal cord protrudes, often \\nresulting in hydrocephalus and other neurological disorders). \\n5. The dependency of methionine synthase on both folate and cobalamin explains why a single deficiency of \\neither vitamin leads to the same megaloblastic changes in the bone marrow and other tissues, with ra pidly \\ndividing cells. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Recommended Dietary Allowance: The individual requirement of folate for both the sexes recommended by ICMR is 100 \\nmcg per day, which increases during pregnancy and lactation to 400 and 150, respectively. The requirements are expressed \\nas dietary folate equivalents (DFE). One DFE is equal to 1 mcg of food folate. As natural folates are m uch less stable, \\nchemically pure folic acid (pteroylmonoglutamate) can be used to provide part of the RNI, by way of fortification or \\nsupplementation. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects: \\nDeficiency:  \\nIf there is inadequate dietary folate, the activity of both the DNA and the methylation cycles, will be reduced. A decrease in \\nthe former will reduce DNA biosynthesis and thereby reduce cell division. The deficiency will be mos t obvious in cells that \\nrapidly divide like the red blood cells, thereby producing megaloblastic anaemia characterized by la rge, abnormally \\nnucleated erythrocytes that accumulate in bone marrow. This results in an increased susceptibility t o infection, decrease in \\nblood coagulation, and intestinal malabsorption. Decrease in activity of the methylation cycle is an independent risk factor \\nfor cardiovascular disease and stroke. \\nPregnant women are at a higher risk of developing folate deficiency because of increase d demand for folate. In addition to \\nmegaloblastic anaemia, inadequate folate intake is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes like clef t lip and palate, limb \\ndeficiencies and the outflow tract defects of the heart.. Impaired folate status is associated wi th increased risk of pre-term \\ndelivery, infant low birth weight and foetal growth .and retardation. Low folate status has been ass ociated with an \\nincreased risk of colorectal cancer. Thus, it is evident that folate is very essential for good health. \\nToxicity: \\nAn upper level of 1000 yg has been prescribed. There is probably no great risk of toxicity at a rang e of intake between 400 \\nand 1000 yg of folic acid per day, with the exception of some increased difficulty in diagnosing pernicious anaemia.'),\n",

Animal products like meat, milk and meat \\nproducts, cereals and legumes are rich sources of this vitamin. Dietary deficiency of this vitamin is rare or unlikely because it \\nis so widespread in food. \\n \\n3.2.10  Biotin \\nBiotin is also essential for the metabolism of fat. Very small amounts are required and sufficient m ay well be made by the \\nbacteria normally inhabiting the large intestine. It is therefore probable  that no additional biotin be provided in the diet, \\nexcept in the very unusual situation when large quantities for raw eggs are consumed. Raw egg white contains avidin which \\ncombines with biotin making it unavailable to the body. \\nRich sources of biotin inc lude offal and egg yolk. Smaller amounts are obtained from milk and dairy products, cereals, fish, \\nfruit and vegetables. \\n \\n3.2.11 Vitamin C \\nAscorbic acid is also known as the anti -scurvy vitamin. Its chemical names are ascorbic acid and ascorbate. It is a derivative \\nof carbohydrate. \\n\\uf0b7 Food Sources \\nFood sources of vitamin C include: \\n Rich sources:   Amla and guava. \\nGood sources:  Drumstick leaves, other leafy vegetables and fruits such as cashew fruit melons, berries, pine \\napple and tomatoes. \\n  Fair sources:     Apples, banana, grapes. \\nVitamin C is found in many fruits and vegetables. Citrus fruits and juices are particularly rich sou rces of vitamin C but other \\nfruits including honeydew melons, cherries, kiwi fruits, mangoes, papaya, strawberries, tomatoes, an d water melon also \\ncontain variable amounts of vitamin C. Vegetables such as cabbage, broccoli, brussels sprouts, bean sprouts, cauliflower, \\nmustard greens, red and green peppers, peas, and potatoes may be more important sources of vitamin C  than fruits, given \\nthat the vegetable supply often extends for longer periods during the year than does the fruit supply. \\nVitamin C content of food is influenced by season, transport to market, and length of time on the sh elf and in storage, \\ncooking practices, and the ch lorination of the water used in cooking. Cutting or bruising of produce releases ascorbate \\noxidase. Blanching inactivates the oxidase enzyme and helps to preserve ascorbate, Heating and exposure to copper or iron \\nor to inildly alkaline conditions destroys the vitamin, and too much water leaches it from the tissues during cooking. \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and elimination: \\nAscorbic acid is absorbed from the intestines primarily by active transport. Simple diffusion contri butes to a small extent of \\nits absorption from the mouth and stomach. It passes through the portal vein to the general circulation and to all t issues. \\nEach organ or tissue has an optimal saturation level of ascorbic acid. It is not stored to any appre ciable extent in the body. \\nUnabsorbed vitamin C may be  metabolized by the intestinal flora. Pectin and zinc are a few substances that impair its \\nabsorption. Excess is excreted in urine. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions of    Vitamin C:   \\nThe vitamin C is involved in several physiological and biochemical functions in the body. \\n1. Enzyme function: Vitamin C acts as an electron donor for 11 enzymes out of which eight are found in humans. \\n2. Protective role as an antioxidant: Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant because it can donate a hydrogen atom and form \\na relatively stable ascorbyl free radical.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='52 \\n \\n3. Synthesis of hormones: Ascorbate is involved in the amidation, thereby conferring stability to hormones. \\n4. Formation of collagen and inter cellular cement substance: The vitamin is required in the formation of collagen and in \\nthe formation of intercellular cement substances for capillaries, teeth, bones etc. When the vitamin is deficient, th ese \\ntissues are not formed fully. \\n5. Absorption of iron and incorporation of plasma iron in .ferritin : A common feature of vitamin C deficiency is anemia. \\nThe antioxidant properties of vitamin C may stabilize folate in food and in plasma. Vitamin C promotes a bsorption of \\nsoluble non-haem iron. \\n6. Reduced cancel- risk: Concentrations of vitamin C appear to be high in gastric juice. Vitamin C present in gastric juice  \\nmay prevent the formation of N -nitroso compounds, which are potentially mutagenic. High intakes of vitamin C \\ncorrelate with reduced gastric cancer risk, and diets with high vitamin C content have been associat ed with lower \\ncancer risk, especially for cancers of the oral cavity, esophagus, stomach, colon and lung. \\n7. Bone formation: Ascorbate is vital for bone formation. In deficiency, though calcification is unaffected, formation of \\nbone matrix and ground substance is defective. Osteoblasts invading the area of calcification change histologically into \\nfibroblasts. The bone matrix is abnormal, as it lacks ossification. \\n8. Wound healing: Ascorbic acid deficiency delays healing of wounds, as collagen formation is affected. The rapid heal ing \\nof wounds requires the formation of strong connective tissue on the scar. \\n9. Cholesterol metabolism: vitamin C plays a protective or curative role in diseases resulting from atherosclerosis through \\nits effect on cholesterol metabolism. It protects low density lipoproteins against oxidation. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Recommended Dietary Allowance: \\nThe ICMR recommendation is 40 mg per day for both adult males and females. The requirements go up by  another 40 mg \\n(total 80 mg) during lactation. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects: \\nDeficiency \\nSevere ascorbic acid deficiency results in the development of the disease known as scurvy. Three important manifestations \\nof scurvy -gingival changes, pain in the extremities and hemorrhagic manifestations – precede edema, ulcerations, and \\nultimately death. The disease occurs in adults and infants . In infants scurvy is seen at the sites of most active bone growth, \\nlike  pseudo paralysis of the limbs caused by extreme pain on movement and hemorrhages as well as, s welling and \\nhemorrhages of the gums surrounding erupting teeth \\nSymptoms of scurvy in adults include: \\n1) General weakness: The first symptoms are weakness, easy fatigue and listlessness. These are followed quickly by \\nshortness of breath, pain in bones, joints and muscles of the extremities. \\n2) Swollen and tender joints and hemorrhage in various tissues: Haemorrhages occur deep in muscle, particularly in calf, \\nthigh, buttocks and forearm, causing pain in surrounding tissues. \\n3) Bleeding gums and loose teeth: As ascorbic acid deficiency advances, the gums become swollen, blue -red, spongy and \\nvery friable. They may become infected by bacteria. The teeth loosen in the alveolar bone. \\nToxicity \\nExcessive doses of vitamin C relates to intra intestinal problems and to the effects of metabolites in the urinary system. \\nIntakes of 2-3 g/day of vitamin C produce unpleasant diarrhea. Further, oxalate is an end -product of ascorbate catabolism \\nand may cause kidney stone formation. \\n3.2.12 Vitamin D \\nVitamin D is a generic term and can either be made in the skin from a cholesterol -like precursor (7-dehydrocholesterol) by \\nexposure to sunlight or can be provided pre -formed in the diet. The version made in the skin is referred to as vitamin D \\nwhereas the dietary form can be either vitamin D3 or a closely-related molecule of plant origin known as vitamin D2.'),\n",

So we have seen that it is not ju st through diet, sunlight can \\nalso help us to manufacture vitamin D. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, Storage and Elimination \\nAs we have already mentioned earlier, all fat-soluble vitamins share a common metabolic fate. Vitamin D is absorbed along \\nwith fats from the duodenum and jejunum. Bile too is essential for the effective absorption of fats and therefore of vitamin \\nD. Vitamin D formed in the skin by the  direct irradiation of the provitamin present in the skin is directly absorbed into the \\nblood stream. The vitamin is stored in concentrated quantities in the liver and to a lesser extent i n the skin, spleen, lungs , \\nbrain and kidney. The main pathway of exc retion of vitamin D is through the bile into the small intestine and consequent \\nfaecal excretion. Only less than four per cent of the intake of the vitamin is excreted by the urinary pathway. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions: Vitamin D is required to maintain normal blood levels  of calcium and phosphate, which are in turn needed for \\nthe normal mineralization of bone, muscle contraction, nerve conduction d general cellular functions in all cells of the body. \\n1. Mobilization of' bone calcium and phosphorus:  The functions of vitamin D are mediated by this vital vitamin D \\nhormone by a homeostatic mechanism which involves the hormone acting on the intestines, kidney and b one to \\nincrease serum calcium and phosphorus levels. This helps to achieve a normal blood calcium concentra tion and \\nmaintenance of calcium homeostatis. \\n2. Mineralization and .formation of  new bone: Vitamin D plays a role in the synthesis of a prominent non collagenous \\nprotein, osteocalcin, a vitamin K dependent protein found in the bone matrix and dentine - which is associate d with \\nnew bone formation. \\n3. Bone growth and development -calcification of osteoid tissue:  Vitamin D participates in metabolic processes \\nassociated with bone growth and development. It is involved in calcification of osteoid tissues. Osteoid is a protein \\nmixture which is secreted by osteoblasts. When it mineralizes, it becomes bone. \\n4. Formation of enzymcs: Vitamin D is essential for the formation of two enzymes alkaline phosphatase in the intestinal \\nlining (involved in calcium transport) and adenosine triphosphatase, (for collagen formation in bone matrix). \\n5. Regulation of amino acid levels in the blood:  Vitamin D helps to prevent loss of amino acids through the kidney and \\nthus regulate the ainino acid level and also regulate the level of citric acid in tissues and bones. \\n6. Participation in muscle formation and metabolism: Vitamin D takes part in muscle function and metabolism. \\n7. lnhibition of cancer cell proliferation and growth: Vitamin D diminishes proliferation of abnormal intestinal, lymphatic, \\nmammary and skeletal cells and provides a potential for the treatment of skin diseases such as psoriasis (a disorder in \\nwhich there is proliferation of the keratinocytes and a failure to differentiate rapidly). \\n8. Role in the immune system:  Immune responses that are mediated by T-cells can be inhibited by large doses of \\ncalcitriol. It is a natural steroid hormone formed in the healthy body as the biologically active fo rm of vitamin D. A \\ndeficiency of vitamin D also interferes with the T-cell mediated immunity. \\n9. Regulation of blood pressure: The renin-angiotensin system regulates the blood pressure. The synthesis of renin is \\ndecreased by calcitriol through its interaction with the vitamin D regulator (VDR). Inappropriate activation of the renin-\\nangiotensin system is thought to play a role in some forms of human hypertension and adequate vitamin D levels may \\nbe important for decreasing the risk of high blood pressure. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Recommended Dietary Allowances for Vitamin D \\nThe recommendations of vitamin D are expressed as IU. 1 IU is defined as  the activity contained in 0.025 m cg of \\ncholecalciferol. The recommended allowances for vitamin D as suggested by ICMR for  Indians is 200 -400 IU. A vitamin D \\nsupplement providing 400 to 800 IUs may be essential for the elderly, particularly who consume les s milk and are totally \\nhome bound.  \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects:  \\nDeficiency \\nInfants constitute a population at-risk for vitamin D deficiency because of relatively large vitamin D needs brought about by \\ntheir high rate of skeletal growth; Breastfed infants are particularly at-risk because of the low concentrations of vitamin D in \\nhuman milk. This problem is further compounded in some infants fed human milk by a restriction in exp osure to ultraviolet\"),\n",

Dietary absence of vitamin D or la ck of UV (sunlight) exposure \\ncauses the bone disease called rickets in infants and children and osteomalacia in adults. \\nToxicity \\nThe adverse effects of high vitamin D intakes include hypercalciuria (excessive urinary calcium excretion) and \\nhypercalcaemia (high concentration of calcium in blood). Excessive amounts of vitamin D are not normally available from \\ndietary sources, and hence cases of vitamin D intoxication are rare. Nevertheless, toxicity may occu r in individuals on \\nexcessive amounts of supplemented vitamins, for example, drinking milk fortified with inappropriately high levels of vitamin \\nD3. The signs and symptoms associated with it are anorexia, nausea and vomiting, followed by polyuria, p olydipsia, \\nweakness, nervousness and pruritis (itchiness). \\n3.2.12  Vitamin E \\nVitamin E is the generic term for tocopherols and tocotrienols. The tocopherols and tocotrienols occur as homologues - a, b \\nand y \\n\\uf0b7 Food Sources of Vitamin E \\nVitamin E is present in almost all foodstuffs. It is found in wheat germ, corn, nuts, seeds, olives, spinach, asparagus and \\nother green leafy vegetables and vegetable oils like groundnut, soy, cottonseed and safflower are ri ch sources. The vitamin \\nE content of edible oils is usually proportional to the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acid content of the oils. \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption and Storage of Vitamin E Absorption of vitamin E from the intestine depends on adequate pancreatic function, \\nbiliary secretion and micelle formation. Conditions for absorption are like those for dietary lipid,  that is, efficient \\nemulsification, solubilization within mixed bile salt micelles, uptake by enterocytes, and secretion  into the circulation via  \\nthe lymphatic system. Emulsification takes place initially in the stomach and then in the small inte stine in the presence of \\npancreatic and biliary secretions. Tocopherol esters, present in processed foods and vitamin supplem ents, must be \\nhydrolyzed in the small intestine before absorption. \\nVitamin E is transported in the blood by the plasma lipoproteins and erythrocytes. F rom a nutritional perspective, the most \\nimportant form of vitamin E is a -tocopherol. It is absorbed faster and retained better than other forms. T11is is due to the \\naction of binding proteins that preferentially select the a form over other forms. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions of Vitamin E  \\nVitamin E is the major lipid -soluble antioxidant in the cell antioxidant defense system and is exclusively obtained from the \\ndiet. The main role of vitamin E and the biological activity of tocopherols are due to its antioxida nt property. Th is \\nantioxidant property of vitamin E is useful for various body processes and substances. \\n1. Protection of poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) from oxidative damage:  The major biological role of vitamin E is to \\nprotect PUFAs and other components of cell membr anes and low -density lipoprotein &DL) from oxidation by free \\nradicals.  \\n2. Protection of erythrocytes: Vitamin E protects erythrocytes from haemolysis by the production of oxidizing agents e.g. \\ndialuric acid and hydrogen peroxide. \\n3. Protection of cell membrane: It protects the cell membrane from getting damaged from naturally occurring peroxides \\nand toxic free radicals formed from fatty acids and oxidative tissue damage as described above. \\n4. Protection against poisoning: It protects liver from injury due to carbon tetrachloride poisoning. \\n5. Protection of both vitamin A and carotene : It protects vitamin A and p -carotene from destruction by oxidation, \\nespecially in the alimentary tract, thus sparing the supply of vitamin A available to the body. \\n6. Synthesis of enzymes and proteins: It serves as a co -repressor in the synthesis of certain enzymes and plays a specific \\nrole in the synthesis of haem proteins. \\n7. Protection of mitochondria: It protects the mitochondria1 function of the muscles and cardiac tissue. Tocopherol acts \\nas an electron acceptor in the electron transport system and prevents the disruption of mitochondria.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"55 \\n \\n8. Reduction in free radical generation: Vitamin E acts synergistically with selenium thereby reducing susceptibility of LDL \\nlo oxidation, free radical generation and membrane damage. This antioxidant role of vitamin E together with selenium \\nprotects against cardiovascular diseases especially atherosclerotic lesions. \\n9. Regulation of enzyme activities: Vitamin E regulates the activity of enzymes, a-aminole vulinic acid (AL4) synthetase in \\nbone marrow and ALA dehydrase in liver, \\n10. Prevention of diseases:  Because of its anti -oxidant function and its role in inhibiting cell proliferation of smooth \\nmuscles, vitamin E can be used for prevention and treatme nt of diseases. Epidemiological studies suggest that dietary \\nvitamin E influences the risk of cardiovascular disease. It has also been suggested that vitamin E supplementation (200-\\n400 mg/day) may be appropriate therapeutically to moderate some aspects of degenerative diseases such as Parkinson \\ndisease, reduce the severity of neurologic disorders such as tardive dyskinesia (potentially irreversible and involuntary \\nmovements), prevent periventricular haemorrhage in pre-term babies, reduce tissue injury arising from ischaernia and \\nreperfusion during surgery, delay cataract development, and improve mobility in arthritis sufferers. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Recommended Dietary Allowances for Vitamin E \\nThe requirements for the vitamin E are expressed in terms of tocopherol equivalents (T E) as mentioned earlier - 8 mg for \\nfemales and 10 mg for males. It has been seen that the adequacy of RDA varies with PUFA content significantly; increased \\nintakes necessitate larger amounts of vitamin E in the diet. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects \\nDeficiency: \\nVitamin E deficiency in human is extremely rare. This may probably be due to its wide occurrence in natural foods. Evidence \\nof deficiency is however seen in individuals with chronic fat malabsorption. Vitamin E deficiency is  a cause of the impaired \\nneuromuscular fun ction, sometimes seen in patients with disorders that interfere with absorption or transport of the \\nvitamin. Symptoms include poor reflexes, impaired locomotion, decreased sensation in the hands and f eet, and changes in \\nthe retina. \\nWe read about the consequences of low intake of vitamin E on the human body. \\n Toxicity:  \\nA very high intake of vitamin E can also elicit severe adverse reactions, as described next. Vitamin  E is relatively non -toxic. \\nAdults tolerate doses as high as 100 to 1,000 IU per day. Howev er, adverse effects such as muscle weakness, fatigue, \\nnausea, diarrhea, double vision, elevation of serum lipids, impaired blood coagulation and reduction  of serum thyroid \\nhormones occur due to indiscriminate ingestion of excessive amounts of vitamin E over long periods of time. \\n3.2.13  Vitamin K \\nVitamin K is an essential fat-soluble micronutrient;  its role in health is in the maintenance of normal coagulation. \\n\\uf0b7 Food sources of Vitamin K \\nThe only important molecular 'form of vitamin K is phylloquinone. Phylloquinone is distributed ubiquitously throughout the \\ndiet, and the ange of concentrations in different food categories is very wide. In general, the highest values (normally in the \\nrange 400-700 mg / 100 g) are found in green leafy vegetables (such as spinach, cauliflower, cabbage and lettuce). The next \\nbest sources are certain vegetable oils (e.g. soybean, rapeseed and olive), which contain 50 -200 mg/100g, other vegetable \\noils, such as peanut, corn, sunflower and safflower, however, contain much lower amou nts of phylloquinone (1-10 mg/100 \\ng). Other good sources include animal foods such as egg yolk, milk and organ meats like liver. \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, Storage and Elimination of Vitamin K \\nDietary vitamin K, mainly phylloquinone, is absorbed chemically unchanged from  the proximal intestine after solubilization \\ninto mixed micelles composed of bile salts and the products of pancreatic lipolysis. Vitamin K is stored in the liver, - the site \\nof synthesis of coagulation proteins.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"56 \\n \\nPhylloquinone levels are high in liver, heart and pancreas. Vitamin K is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted in \\nthe urine and bile. About 60 -70% of the amount of' phylloquinone absorbed from each meal will ultimately be lost to the \\nbody by excretion. This, therefore, suggests that the body stores of phylloquinone are being constantly replenished. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions of Vitamin K \\nThe functions of vitamin K are both physiological and biochemical. These include: \\n1) Blood coagulation: The primary function of vitamin K in the body is in the maintenan ce of normal blood coagulation. \\nThe vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins are synthesized in the liver and comprise Factor IT (prothrombin), Factor \\nVII (proconvertin), Factor IX (Christmas factor) and Factor X (Stuart factor), which have a haemostatic r ole i.e. they are \\nprocoagulants that arrest and prevent bleeding. \\n2) Vitamin K-dependent carboxylation: Vitamin K acts as a cofactor in the synthesis of y carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) from \\nglutamic acid residues required for the normal coagulation of blood. \\n3) Vitamin K dependent proteins: The four vitamin K-dependent procoagulant (factor 11 or prothrombin, and factors VII, \\nIX, and X), about which we studied above, are serine proteases that are synthesized in the liver and then secreted into \\nthe circulation as inac tive forms (zymogens). Two other vitamin K -dependent proteins, protein C and protein S, play a \\nregulatory role in the inhibition of coagulation. \\n4) Prevents bone loss: Vitamin K is known to inhibit bone loss through inhibiting effect on osteoblast formation. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Recommended Dietary Allowances \\nRecommended dietary intakes have not been suggested for different age groups or gender. The safe lev els of intake is 80 \\nmcg for adult males and 65 mcg for adult females. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects \\nVitamin K in excess or low intakes can have serious implications on human health. Although such conditions are rare, they \\ncan often be life-threatening. Vitamin K deficiency leads to a lowered prothrombin level and increased clotting time, which \\ncould lead to hemorrhages. The population groups that appear most at risk for vitamin K deficiency are newborn infants \\nand people who have been injurecl and have renal insufficiency. The increased risk for infants fed on human milk compared \\nwith formula milk is probably related to the relatively low conc entrations of vitamin K (phylloquinone) in breast milk \\ncompared with formula milks. \\nRefer to tables 3.2.1 to 3.2.11 for ICMR RDIs of vitamins for Indians \\n3.3          Classification of Minerals, its sources, digestion, absorption, functions and nutritional requirement \\nWe have already learnt that minerals or inorganic elements are necessary for the optimal functioning  of the human body. \\nMinerals have three major functions: \\na) As constituents of the bones and teeth. These include calcium, phosphorus and magnesium. \\nb) As soluble salts which help to control the composition of the body fluids and cells. These include s odium and \\nchlorine in the fluids outside the cells ex. Blood and potassium, magnesium and phosphorus inside the cells. \\nc) As essential adjuncts to many enzymes and other proteins such as hemoglobin which are necessary for the release \\nand utilization of energy. Iron and phosphorus act in this way along with other elements. \\nThese seven elements are in general needed in the greatest amounts in the diet a nd are present in the largest amounts in \\nthe body tissues together with sulphur and are thus considered as major minerals. The remainders are equally essential but \\nneeded in small quantities and are called trace elements. Excess of most of these can be poisonous. \\n3.3.1 Calcium \\nAmong minerals, calcium (Ca) is most abundantly present in humans, representing 52% of the body's mi neral content and \\namounting to 1.2% of body weight. In the elementary composition of the human body, calcium ranks fif th after oxygen,\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='57 \\n \\ncarbon, hydrogen and nitrogen, and it makes up 1.9% of the body by weight. Nearly all (99%) of total  body calcium is \\nlocated in the skeleton together with more than three quarters of the body’s phosphorus. The remaini ng 1 % is equally \\ndistributed between the teeth and soft tissues, with only 0.1% in the extracellular fluid (ECF). \\n\\uf0b7 Food sources of Calcium: \\nDairy products are of course the primary source of calcium followed by grains and pulses. Among the millets, ragi contains a \\ngood amount of calcium. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions: \\nCalcium salts provide rigidity to the skeleton and calcium ions play a role in many if not most, met abolic processes. An \\nunderstanding of the role of calcium in skeletal structures requires that the process of bone format ion and mineralization \\nbe clearly comprehend. Bone is unique living tissue as it is rigid and strong and at the same time light e nough to be moved \\nby coordinated muscle contractions. There are two types of bones: the cortisone, densely packed mineralized collagen laid \\ndown in layers a nd the ti+nbecullal bone (cancellous bones), which is spongy and provides strength and elasticity. In \\naddition to the structural role in bones, Ca also performs other functions in the body. These functions include:  \\n1) Clotting of blood  \\n2) Nerve conduction \\n3) Muscle contraction \\n4) Enzyme regulation \\n5) Membrane permeability \\nIonized Ca is chiefly involved in these functions. As the levels of serum total and ionic calcium ar e tightly controlled, these \\nfunctions are well regulated. Bone mineral serves as the ultimate reservoir for the calcium. \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and excretion: \\nCalcium (Ca) in food occurs as calcium salts e.g. calcium phosphate or is associated with other diet ary constituents e.g. \\ncalcium caseinate in milk. Before absorption, Ca must be released from foods and solubilized. This is achieved by the \\ncombined actions of gastric acid, intestinal enzymes, intestinal contractions and peristalsis. When calcium intake is low, \\ncalcium is mainly absorbed by active (transcellular) transport, but at higher intakes, an in creasing proportion of calcium is \\nabsorbed by simple (paracellular) diffusion. Thus, calcium is absorbed from the intestine by transce llular route and \\nparacellular route. \\nNot more than 4% (8 mg) of dietary Ca is absorbed by the colon per day. The unabsorbe d component which appears in the \\nfeces together with the unabsorbed component of digestive juice calcium is known as endogenous fecal calcium. The feces, \\ntherefore, contain unabsorbed dietary calcium and digestive juice calcium that was not reabsorbed.  Calcium is also \\nexcreted approximately in equal amounts in urine and through intestinal secretions. Bile and other s ecretions into the \\nintestine account for 150 mg calcium per day of which 30% is reabsorbed. Losses through skin, hair a nd nails also need to \\nbe taken into account (insensible losses). Sweat losses are minimal, about 15 mg/day. Total calcium los s may thus amount \\nto 350 mg/day. \\nWe must remember the fact that the amount of calcium that we eat need not be the amount of calcium that gets absorbed. \\nSeveral factors affect the proportion of dietary calcium absorbed by humans, also known as fractional absorption of dietary \\ncalcium. Age is one factor which influences the absorption of calcium. Fractional absorption of calcium is highes t in infancy \\n@ 6O%, fo llowed by the early pubertal period. Absorption of calcium is also increased in pregnancy to levels higher than \\n25% reported in adults. Available data suggests that in post menopausal women, absorption declines by 0.21% every year. \\nThus, from 50 years Lo 7 0 years, absorption may decline by 4%. Food is another factor. Calcium is poorly absorbed from \\nfoods that are rich in oxalic acid or phytic acid. Phytates, present in the husk of many cereals, as  well as, in nuts, seeds, and \\nlegumes, can form insoluble calcium phytate salts in the gastrointestinal tract. Excess oxalates can precipitate calcium in the \\nbowel. In comparison to calcium absorption from milk, calcium absorption from phytic acid rich grain s is one half and from \\nspinach it is only one tenth. This is so because spinach is high in oxalic acid. Majority of the calcium absorbed is stored in the \\nbones/skeletal tissues.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"58 \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Nutritional requirement and RDA for Calcium : \\nRequirements for calcium depend upon the rate at which calcium is incorporated into bone; they are therefore highest \\nduring periods of growth, especially during infancy and adolescence and fall after peak bone mass is  achieved at about 25 \\nyears of age. The RDA for Indian adult male is based on replacing the losses of calcium in urine, stools, bile and sweat, which \\nis estimated to be 700 mg calcium per day. The fractional absorption in adults is taken to be 20 -30% in the presence of \\nadequate vitamin D. Additional calcium for growth, pregnancy and lactation are calculated separately. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects: \\nDeficiency \\nIf there is a continued inadequate intake or poor intestinal absorption of calcium, plasma calcium c oncentrations will be \\nmaintained from increased bone resorption. The cumulative effect of calcium depletion on the skeleto n over many years \\ncontributes to the increasing frequency of fractures with age. Prolonged inadequate calcium intake in young growing \\nchildren with red~~cthee rate of accretion of the skeleton and may prevent the attainment of the gen etically determined \\nmaximal bone mass. In extreme cases, Ca deficiency can give rise to rickets in children. \\nCalcium and Osteoporosis: Accelerated bone loss with age is a consistent finding in both women and men. It occurs earlier \\nin women than in men as decreased estrogen production in menopause is associated with accelerated bone loss in women, \\nestimated at 3% per year in the first five years after menopause. The effectiveness of calcium supplements in retard ing \\nbone loss in post menopausal women is not entirely settled. However, clinical trials in this area seem to indicate that \\nsupplements of calcium can have beneficial effect in slowing the rate of bone loss in post menopausal women. \\nCalcium and Hypertension: Chronic inadequate intake of calcium may play some role in etiologies of hypertension.  Calcium \\ndeficiency has been linked to hypertension \\nToxicity \\nElevated blood calcium can occur in association with high parathyroid hormone, hyper - or hypothyroid conditions, bone \\nmetastasis, vitamin D toxicity, excess intake or absorption of calcium, Addis on's disease and with thiazide diuretics. High \\nblood calcium may be asymptomatic or can cause constipation, nausea and vomiting, increased urinatio n, thirst, muscle \\nweakness, kidney failure, irritability, confusion, psychosis and coma. The role of calcium supplements in eliciting \\nhypercalcaemia has always been under scrutiny. Since the efficiency of absorption from large doses i s poor, no adverse \\neffects have been found with calcium supplements providing up to 2400 mg/day. However, at such high levels, iron  \\nabsorption is reduced and risk of iron deficiency increases. A practical suggestion would be not to consume high dose of \\ncalcium with meals that provide most of the iron. Supplements of calcium do not carry the risk for r enal stones in ilorinal \\nindividuals but can increase the risk in patients with renal hypercaliuria. In fact, it has been suggested tha t dietary calcium \\nmay protect against renal calculi because it binds dietary oxalate and reduces oxalate excretion. An  upper limit on calcium \\nintake of 3 g daily is recommended by the FAO/WHO 2004. \\n Refer to table no.3.1 for ICMR RDIS for calcium for Indians \\n3.3.2  Phosphorus \\nPhosphorus is the second most abundant element in the human body, comprising 30% of the total minera l content. An \\nadult human body cont ains approximately 600 g of phosphorus. Most phosphorus like Ca (as calcium phosphate) is stored \\nin the bone and teeth in an inorganic metal state . The remaining 15% is distributed in soft tissues in both organic and \\ninorganic form. Phosphates play an esse ntial role in the liberation and utilization of energy from food. They are also \\nconstituents of nucleic acids and some fats, proteins and carbohydrates and must be combined with B-vitamins in the body \\nbefore the latter can be active. \\n\\uf0b7 Food sources of Phosphorus \\nPhosphorus is widely distributed in food. Food phosphorus is a mixture of both organic and inorganic  forms although the \\nrelative amounts vary with the type of food. Both animal and plant foods are important sources and i nclude meat, fish\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"59 \\n \\npoultry, egg, milk and its products, nuts, legumes and cereals. 80% of phosphorus in grains is bound with p hytic acid. In \\nmilk, 33% is in the inorganic form. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions: \\nDistribution of phosphorus in body clearly explains that it functions as a structural  component, as well as, has a role in \\nmetabolic reactions. \\nInorganic Phosphorus: The major functions of inorganic phosphorus include:  \\n1) Structural component of bones and teeth: Phosphorus is a part of calcium phosphate in various crystalline. Ca forms \\nrequired for ossification. \\n2) Acid-base balance: Within cells, phosphate is the main intracellular buffer. \\n     Organic Phosphorus: It is involved in the following reactions/components:  \\n1) Structural component of nucleic acids: It is important component of DNA and RNA.   \\n2) Components of cell membrane: Phospholipids with their polar and non polar regions are important for the bi layer \\nstructure of cell membranes. \\n3) Phosphorus is of vital importance in intermediary metabolism of the energy nutrients contributing to  temporar y \\nstorage and transfer of energy. \\n4) Component of coenzymes like NADP, TPP, PLP, coenzyme A, FAD, NAD \\n5) Many enzymatic activities are controlled by alternating phosphorylation or dephosphorylation. Thus, it is required in \\nregulating metabolism. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and excretion: \\nAs you have seen that food contains both organic and inorganic phosphorus, but most of it is absorbed in its inorganic form. \\nTherefore, organically bound phosphorous is hydrolyzed in the lumen by intestinal phosphatases. However, org anic \\nphosphate of phytic acid may not be available. Phosphorus absorption occurs throughout the small int estine, although \\nduodenum and jejunum are important sites. Phosphorus absorption is efficient -60-70%. Ingestion of antacids containing \\nmagnesium or aluminum hydroxide can interfere with phosphorus absorption. \\nIt is important to note that unlike calcium, absorption efficiency of phosphorus does not increase o n low intake nor any \\nadaptive mechanism is available for the same. Most phosphorus is absorbed by passive concentration dependent process. \\nUnabsorbed phosphorus is excreted in feces. Excretion of endogenous phosphorus is mainly through kidney. \\n\\uf0b7 Nutritional requirement and RDA for Phosphorus \\nThe requirements of phosphorus are closely linked with those of  calcium. Phosphate requirements are fully met usually \\nwhen diets provide adequate calcium as these two minerals generally occur together in foods. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects \\nSituations' may develop when the phosphate levels in blood and other tissues may increase or decrease beyond normal \\nlevels. Such disturbances in the phosphorus levels may develop with or without any effects in the calcium metabolism. \\nDeficiency \\nInadequate phosphorus intake results in abnormally low serum phosphate levels (hypophosphatemia). Th e ef fects of \\nhypophosphatemia may include loss of appetite, anemia, muscle weakness, bone pain, rickets (in child ren), osteomalacia \\n(in adults), increased susceptibility to infection, numbness and tingling of the extremities, and di fficulty in walking. Seve re \\nhypophosphatemia may result in death. Because phosphorus is so widespread in food, dietary phosphoru s deficiency is \\nusually seen only in cases of near total starvation. Other individuals at -risk of hypophosphatepia include alcoholics, \\ndiabetics recovering from an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis, and starving or anorexic patients.\"),\n",

Such calcium phosphate deposition can lead to organ damage, especially \\nkidney damage. \\n3.3.3  Magnesium \\nAfter calcium, and potassium,Magnesium (Mg) is found in abundance in body but it is the least abunda nt among macro \\nminerals, the total amount in the body  being 25 g. Like Ca and P, this mineral is also present in the bones but unlike them \\nwhich constitute 99% and 85% of the bones, only 55 -60% of total magnesium is located in the skeleton. Another 20 -25% is \\nfound in muscles with remaining in other soft tiss ues. Only 1% of total body magnesium is extracellular. Magnesium is \\nclosely associated with cells and is second to potassium in abundance in cells. \\n\\uf0b7 Food sources: \\nMagnesium is widely distributed in variety of foods and beverages. In plants it is associated with chlorophyll. Thus, green \\nleafy vegetables are excellent sources of magnesium. Most green vegetables, legume seeds, beans, tea , coffee, cocoa and \\nnuts are rich in magnesium, as are some shellfish, spices, and soya flour, all of which usually cont ain more than 500 mg/kg \\nfresh weight. Although most unrefined cereal grains are reasonable sources, many highly -refined flours, tubers, fruits and \\nmost oils and fats contribute little dietary magnesium (<100m g/kg fresh weight).  Refining of whole cereals can red uce the \\nmagnesium content by 80%. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions: Like Ca, Mg too has a role in bone formation. Soft tissue magnesium functions as a cofactor of many enzymes \\ninvolved in energy metabolism, protein synthesis, RNA and DNA synthesis, and maintenance of the elec trical potential of \\nnervous tissues and cell membranes. \\n1) Between 50% and 60% of body magnesium is located within bone, where it is thought to form a surface \\nconstituent of the hydroxyapatite (calcium phosphate) mineral component. \\n2) Within cells, Mg is bound to phospholipids of the cell membrane (plasma, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum). It \\nhelps in membrane stabilization. \\n3) Mg is responsible for the structural integrity of the subunits forming ribosome. It also maintains d ouble helical \\nstructure of DNA. \\n4) Intracellular free Mg+2 regulate ion movements. \\n5) Mg is vital for energy production as it is required b-y ATP synthesizing protein in the mitochondria. \\n6) As intracellular component, it is essential for different enzyme reactions, as structural cofactor o r an alloster ic \\nactivator of enzyme activity. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and excretion: \\nMagnesium absorption to some extent is similar to that of Ca. Absorption of Mg occurs throughout the  small intestine, \\nalthough jejunum and ileum are important sites. It crosses the intest inal membrane by both active transport and passive \\ndiffusion. Colon may also play a role in its absorption. About 30 -65% of dietary Mg is absorbed in healthy adults. Like Ca, \\nabsorption of Mg is also more efficient when its status is marginal or intake is low. High intake of dietary fiber  (40-50 g/day) \\nlower magnesium absorption. This is probably attributable to the magnesium -binding action  of phytate phosphorus \\nassociated with the fibre. However, consumption of phytateand  cellulose-rich products increases  magnesium intake (as \\nthey usually contain high concentrations of magnesium) which often compensates for the decrease in absorption. Lactose, \\nfructose and protein appear to increase its absorption. Magnesium homeostasis is maintained chiefly by controlling its \\nexcretion through urine. The kidney has a very significant role in magnesium homeostasis. Active rea bsorption of \\nmagnesium takes place in the Loop of Henle in the proximal convoluted tubule. About 70% of serum Mg is filtered by \\nkidney, but 95% of this  is reabsorbed by a healthy kidney. Regulation of Mg homeostasis occurs chiefly through renal \\nexcretion.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"61 \\n \\nNutritional requirement and RDA for Phosphorus: \\nSince plant foods are particularly high in magnesium, a vegetarian diet with plenty of green vegetab les is unlikely to cause \\nMg deficiency. No specific recommendation is made by ICMR for Mg intakes in Indians. However, the FA O/WHO 2004 \\nrecommended nutrient intake for magnesium as 220 and 260 mg magnesium per day for adult females and males, \\nrespectively whereas no increment for pregnancy but around 50 mg/day increment for lactation. \\nHealth aspects \\nDeficiency \\nDeficiency of magnesium is rare for two reasons: firstly, the mineral is widely distributed in the f oods; secondly, kidney is  \\nable to adjust re-absorption of filtered magnesium to body needs. Studies have shown that a decline in urinary magnesium \\nexcretion during protein energy malnutrition (PEM) is accompanied by a reduced intestinal absorption  of magnesium. The \\ncatch-up growth associated with recovery from PEM is achieved only if magnesium supply is increased substantially. \\nToxicity \\nExcessive intake of Mg is not likely to cause toxicity except in people with impaired renal function . Excessive intakes of Mg \\nsalts such as MgSO4 can lead to diarrhea. \\n3.3.4 Sodium, Potassium and Chloride \\nThese  three macro minerals, Na, K and Cl are related to each other and hence will be discussed toge ther, which makes it \\neasier to appreciate their roles in metabolism. Sodium and potassium are monovalent cations (ions th at carry a positive \\ncharge) while chloride is a monovalent anion (ions that carry a negative charge). All three are known as electrolytes as their \\nions are used for generating electric charge differences across the plasma membrane of most cells. Na constitutes 2%; K 5% \\nand C1 3% of the total mineral content of the body. These minerals exist as ions in the body fluids and are principal \\nelectrolytes in the body. Potassium is a major intracellular electrolyte while sodium and chloride a re present in the \\nextracellular fluids. \\n\\uf0b7 Food sources: \\nCommon salt added to our food in the form of sodium chloride is the major source of sodium and chlor ide. Naturally \\noccurring sources of sodium are milk, meats, eggs and most vegetables. In addition, food additives u sed in processed foods \\nsuch as baking powder, preservatives etc. contribute towards dietary sodium intake. Therefore, it is  important to take note \\nof all these while calculating the sodium content of diets, On the other hand, potassium is abundant  in unprocessed foods, \\nfruits, many vegetables and fresh meats. Also many salt substitutes contain potassium instead of sodium. \\nFunctions: \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and excretion: \\nAll these three elements are readily absorbed from the small intestine with almost 90 -100% efficiency. They are excreted \\nprimarily via urine, although feces and sweat are other sources of elimination. It is important to note that profuse sweating \\ncan result in substantial losses of these elements. Potassium is absorbed in the.smal1 intestine as a consequence o f bulk \\nfluid absorption. \\nBoth sodium and potassium are absorbed in the distal colon. Renal excretion and retention of these e lements is closely \\nregulated. The total content of body sodium especially the concentration in the extracellular fluid (ECF) is und er \\nhomeostatic control. The regulation of chloride is achieved indirectly through sodium regulation. Li ke sodium, the \\nmaintenance of K balance also depends on the kidney. Unlike sodium, the transport of K is bi-directional during the passage \\nof the filtrate through nephrons. In the proximal tubule and loop of Henle, major portion of filtered K is reabsor bed. In the \\ndistal tubule, it can be reabsorbed from the filtrate or can be secreted into it depending on the bo dy's need. Aldosterone \\nacts reciprocally on Na and K. This hormone stimulates sodium reabsorption, but it accelerates the secretion of potassium  \\nand thus increases its excretion. It is important to note that body's ability to conserve sodium by restricting loss in the urine \\nis more efficient than it s ability to conserve potassium. Also, sodium is absorbed more efficiently from the gastrointestinal  \\nthan potassium. Therefore, potassium deficiency will appear before sodium deficiency.\"),\n",

Hyponatremia  is defined as a Na level under 130 mM/L. When plasma Na level falls below 120 \\nmM/L, symptoms such as headache, confusion, seizures and coma can occur.  Hvpernatremia occurs less commonly and is \\ndefined as serum sodium level above 145 mM/L. The initial symptoms include irritability, lethargy and restlessness. Seizures \\nand death may occur when plasma levels rise above 160 mM/L. \\nHypokalemia and Hyperkalemia: Normal serum K ranges from 3.5-5 mM/L. \\nHypokalemia or low plasma K levels can occur with a net shift of potassium from the plasma to the cells. This shift can occur \\nin alkalosis. Overall d epletion of body's K, which occurs in vomiting, prolonged fasting can also result in this shift. Mil d \\nhypokalemia results in weakness and muscle cramps and can cause arrhythmias in patients with heart d iseases. Severe \\nhypokalemia (<2.5 mM/L of K) can result in paralysis. Hyperkalemia occurs when serum K levels are greater than 5 m M/L. \\nHigh plasma K results in cardiac arrhythmias. A potassium level of 8.0 mM/L can cause cardiac arrest and death. \\nRefer to tables  \\n3.3.5 MICRO MINERALS \\nA trace element or micromineral can be defined as a chemical or element present in minute quantities; especially one used \\nby organisms and essential to their physiology. It is an organic compound essential in minute amounts for the growth and \\nhealth of an an imal. Like macro minerals, micro minerals must also be present in the body in optimal range for normal \\nfunctioning. Whenever, the concentration is too low or too high, body functions are impaired. Knowledge of the exact roles \\nand dietary requirements for t hese minerals is incomplete as some of them have been recently found to be essential, for \\nsome their dietary deficiencies are unknown and for some the utilization of them in the body may be affected by the \\namount of other elements present.   \\n3.3.5.1  IRON \\nIron is one of the most investigated minerals in nutrition. We associate iron with its presence in b lood and that its \\ndeficiency results in low hemoglobin levels and hence anemia. In humans, the total quantity of iron in the body varies with \\nhemoglobin concentration, body weight, gender and the amount of iron stored in various tissues. Healthy adults con tain \\nabout 3 to 4gm of iron more than half of which is in the form of hemoglobin, the red pigment of bloo d. Iron is also present \\nin the muscle protein myoglobin and is stored to some extent in organs such as the liver. \\n\\uf0b7 Food sources of Iron: \\nIron is found in foods in one of the two forms i.e. haem or non-haem. In the human diet, the primary sources of hem iron \\nare the hemoglobin and myoglobin from consumption of meat, poultry and fish whereas non -hem iron is obtained from \\ndried apricots, raisins, cereals, pulses, legumes, fruits and vegetables. Dietary non -hem iron accounts for about 85% of the \\ntotal iron intake even among non-vegetarians. \\nFunctions: \\nIron has s everal vital functions in the body. It serves as a carrier of oxygen to the tissues from the lungs b y red blood cell \\nhemoglobin, as a transport medium for electrons within cells, and as an integrated part of important  enzyme systems in \\nvarious tissues. The general classification of the reactions in which iron is involved includes: \\n\\uf0a7 Oxygen transport and storage \\n\\uf0a7 Electron transfer \\n\\uf0a7 Substrate oxidation- reduction\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"63 \\n \\nIron participates in a large number of biochemical reactions. However, for iron to perform any funct ion, it first needs to be \\ntaken up by the cells.  Cell membranes contain a protein specific for binding transferrin called 'transferrin receptor'. \\nTransferrin containing two ferric ions, binds to this receptor. Within the cell, iron is released from transferrin. \\nAs a part of hemoglobin, iron is required for the transport of oxygen, to all cells in the body. Thu s, hemoglobin is critical for \\ncell respiration. Most of the iron in the body is present in the erythrocytes as hemoglobin, a molec ule composed of four \\nunits, each containing one hem group and one protein chain. The structure of hemoglobin allows it to  be fully loaded with \\noxygen in the lungs and partially unloaded in the tissues  like in the muscles.The  iron-containing oxygen storage protein in \\nthe muscles, myoglobin, is similar in structure to hemoglobin but has only one haem unit and one globin chain. As \\nmyoglobin, iron functions as a ready source of oxygen to the muscles. \\nHence Iron is thus crucial for the survival, growth and normal functioning of the human system. \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and excretion: \\nLike other minerals, we obtain iron from the diet, which is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. A unique feature of iron \\nmetabolism is that the body re utilizes quantitatively the iron released from the degradation of erythrocytes, with very little \\nbeing excreted. Hence, it is very frequently mentioned that once iron enters the body, the body holds on to it tenaciously. \\nBefore it can be absorbed, iron whether it is in the form of haem or non -haem, must be released from the food matrices \\nwhere it is bond with other constituents. Proteases (the enzyme) in the stomach and small intestine hydrolyze haem iron \\nfrom the globin portion of haemoglobin or myoglob in. In the case of non -haem iron, gastric secretion including HCl and \\npepsin aid its release from food components. Most non -haem iron is present in the ferric form which is reduced to ferrous \\nform in the acidic environment of the stomach. \\nThe body has thre e unique mechanisms for maintaining iron balance. The first is the continuous reutilization of iron from \\ncatabolized erythrocytes in the body. The second mechanism involves access to the specific storage p rotein, ferritin. This \\nprotein stores iron in perio ds of relatively low need and releases it to meet excessive iron demands. This iron reservoir is \\nespecially important in the third trimester of pregnancy. The third mechanism involves the regulatio n of absorption of iron \\nfrom the intestines; decreasing bod y iron stores trigger increased iron absorption and increasing iron stores trigger \\ndecreased iron absorption. Iron absorption decreases until equilibrium is established between absorption and requirement. \\nTransferrin is a glycoprotein and has two binding sites for Fe3+. It acts as an iron transport protein. Normally, in plasma it is \\none-third saturated with ferric ions. It distributes iron throughout the body to wherever it is needed, mostly to erythrocyte \\nprecursors in the bone marrow. Any absorbed iron in excess of body needs is stored in the liver, in two forms, as ferritin \\nand haemosiderin. Ferritin and haemosiderin are the two major iron storage proteins. Our body has a limited capacity t o \\nexcrete iron once it has been absorbed. Daily losses in adult man are between 0.9 to 1.05 mg. About 0.08 mg is lo st via \\nurine, 0.2 mg via skin, and remaining in the feces. Women in the reproductive age lose more iron owing to menstrual cycles. \\nNutritional requirement and RDA for Iron: \\nThe requirements for iron, as recommended by ICMR, for various age -groups, are based on iron absorption of 3% in adult \\nmen, adolescent boys and children; 5% in adult women, adolescent girls, lactating women, and 8% in pregnant women. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects: \\nDeficiency \\nIron deficiency is one of the most prevalent nutritional deficiencies in the world today. It is esti mated that 2 billion people \\nworldwide suffer from different degrees of iron deficiency, about half of them, manifesting iron def iciency anemia. Iron \\ndeficiency and iron deficiency anemia are often incorrectly used as synonyms. Iron deficiency is defined as a hemoglobin \\nconcentration below the optimum value in an individual, whereas iron deficiency anemia implies that the hemoglobin \\nconcentration is below the 95th percentile o f the distribution of hemoglobin concentration in a population. \\nThe progression from adequate iron status to iron deficiency anemia develops in three overlapping stages. The first stage is \\ndepletion of storage i ron with serum ferritin levels starting to decline. However, the transferrin saturation, erythrocyte  \\nprotoporphyrin and hemoglobin are within normal limits. As iron stores get increasingly depleted, ir on deficiency develops\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"64 \\n \\nwhich is the second stage. During this stage, in addition to low serum ferritin levels, transferrin saturation is also reduced \\nand erythrocyte protoporphyrin is elevated. Hemoglobin may be normal. Eventually when iron deficienc y progresses to \\nanemia, hemoglobin levels start declining; this is the third and final stage of iron deficiency. \\nThe functional effects of iron deficiency anemia result from both a reduction in circulating hemoglo bin and a reduction in \\niron-containing enzymes and myoglobin. \\nThese include: \\n\\uf0b7 fatigue, restlessness and impaired work performance, \\n\\uf0b7 disturbance in thermoregulation, \\n\\uf0b7 impairment of certain key steps in immune response, \\n\\uf0b7 adverse effects on psychomotor and mental development particularly in children, \\n\\uf0b7 Increased maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. \\nIn humans, about 10% of brain-iron is present at birth; at the age of 10 years, the brain has only reached half its normal iron \\ncontent and optimal amounts are first reached between the ages of 20 and 30 years. Several groups ha ve demonstrated a \\nrelationship between iron deficiency and attention, memory and learning in infants and small children. 70% or more of the \\npre-school children, 90% or more of pregnant women and adolescent girls suffer from either iron deficien cy or iron \\ndeficiency anemia in India. T he serious functional effects of iron deficiency anemia on learning, cognition and physical \\nperformance in children and productivity in adults, as well as, increased maternal 'and pre -natal mortality in pregnant \\nwomen make it imperative to prevent and or t reat iron deficiency as a priority. There is a major National programme, the \\nNational Nutritional Anemia Control  Programme that aims to prevent and treat anemia in pregnant women using a public \\nhealth approach. Iron (100 mg elemental iron) and folic acid ( 0.5 mg) in the form of tablets are provided to all pregnant \\nwomen for 100 days during a pregnancy through the ICDS. Nutritional iron deficiency implies that the  diet cannot supply \\nenough iron to coves the body's physiological requirements for this mineral.  Worldwide, this is the most common cause of \\niron deficiency. In many tropical countries, infestations with hookworms lead to intestinal blood lo sses that in some \\nindividuals can be considerable. \\nToxicity: \\nAn excessive body burden of iron can be produced by greater -than-normal absorption from the alimentary canal, by \\nparenteral injection or by a combination of both. For instance, people with genetic defects develop iron overload as it \\noccurs in idiopathic hemochromatosis. It is a hereditary disorder of iron metabolism  characterized by abnormally high iron \\nabsorption owing to a failure of the iron  absorption control mechanism at the intestinal level. High deposits of iron in the \\nliver and the heart can lead to cirrhosis, hepatocellular cancer, congestive heart failure and eventual death. \\n \\nRefer to Table no.3.3.5.1 for ICMR RDIs of iron for Indians \\n3.3.5.2 ZINC \\nZinc is present in all body tissues and fluids. The total body zinc content has been estimated to be  30 mmol or 2 g. Skeletal \\nmuscle accounts for approximately 60% of the total body content and bone mass, with a zinc concentra tion of \\napproximately 30%. The concentration of zinc in lean body mass is approximately 0.46 mmol/g .Plasma zinc has a rapid \\nturnover rate and it represents only about 0.1% of total body zinc content. This level appears to be under close homeostatic \\ncontrol. High concentrations of zinc are found in the choroid of the eye (4.2 mmol/g) and in prostat ic fluids (4.6-7.7 mmol/l \\nor 300 -500 mg/L). \\n\\uf0b7 Food sources of Zinc: \\nZinc is normally associated with the protein and or nucleic acid fraction of foods. \\nThus, foods high in proteins are good sources of zinc. Lean red meat, whole -grain cereals, pulses and legumes provide the \\nhighest concentration s of zinc: concentrations in such foods are generally in the range of 25 -50 mg/kg of raw weight. \\nProcessed cereals with low extraction rates, polished rice, and chicken, pork or meat with high fat content have moderate \\nzinc content, typically between 10 and 25 mg/kg. Fish, roots and tubers, green leafy' vegetables, and fruits are only modest\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='65 \\n \\nsources of zinc, having concentrations < 10 mg/kg. Saturated fats and oils, sugar and alcohol have v ery low zinc contents. \\nZinc is present in high amounts in nuts and r ed meat. Among seafood, oysters are very high in zinc. Other good animal \\nsources include poultry, pork and dairy products. Among the foods of plant origin, legumes, whole gr ain cereals and \\nvegetables (leafy vegetables and roots) are the good sources. Refining of cereals reduce the content to a large extent. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions: \\nZinc is an essential component of a large number of enzymes participating in the synthesis and degradation of \\ncarbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids, as well as, in the metabolism o f other micronutrients. Zinc stabilizes the \\nmolecular structure of cellular components and membranes and in this way contributes to the maintena nce of cell and \\norgan integrity. Furthermore, zinc has an essential role in polynucleotide transcription and thu s, in the process of genetic \\nexpression. Zinc also plays a central role in the immune system, affecting a number of aspects of ce llular and humoral \\nimmunity. \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and excretion: \\nLike iron, zinc also needs to be liberated from food prior to a bsorption. During digestive process; proteases, nucleases and \\nhydrochloric acid all appear to release zinc bound to proteins and nucleic acids. Zinc is absorbed t hroughout the small \\nintestine, with absorption being most efficient in the jejunum. Zinc given as aqueous solution to fasting subjects is absorbed \\nto the extent of 60 -70%. However, absorption from solid diets is less efficient and varies widely depending upon the \\ncontent of the zinc in the meal and the composition of the diet. Phytates are present in whole-grain cereals and legumes \\nand in smaller amounts in other vegetables. They have a strong potential for binding divalent cation s and their depressive \\neffect on zinc absorption has been demonstrated in humans. After absorption, zinc is bound to albu min and transported to \\nthe liver. In liver, it is concentrated and then transported to different tissues by various plasma proteins. Zinc is taken up by \\nvarious tissues and is incorporated in different enzymes. Zinc is found in most organs, concentratio n being higher in liver, \\nkidney, muscle, skin and bone. Zinc content of muscle, brain, lungs and heart is relatively stable a nd does not respond to \\nchanges in dietary zinc intake. Similarly, release of zinc from bones is very slow and does not contribute zinc to other tissues \\nduring deprivation. Zinc is excreted primarily through the following three routes: \\ni) Gastrointestinal tract: Majority of zinc is lost from the body in feces. \\nii) Kidney: Very small amount of zinc is excreted in the urine (0.3-0.7 mg/day), as most of the zinc filtered by \\nthe kidney is reabsorbed. Starvation and muscle catabolism increase zinc losses in urine. \\niii) Body surface: Loss of zinc occurs due to the exfoliation of skin and sweating (0.7 -1.0 mg/day). Another \\nroute of zinc loss is hair, whic h contains 0.1 -0.2 mg Zdg hair. Strenuous exercise and elevated ambient \\ntemperatures can lead to high losses through perspiration. \\n\\uf0b7 Nutritional requirement and RDA for Zinc: \\nThe requirement for adult males is 11 mg/day and adult females are 8 mg/day. It is increased to 11 mg during pregnancy \\nand 12 mg during lactation. A tolerable upper limit of 40 mg/day for adults has been advised by the US Food and Nutrition \\nBoard. Intakes in excess of 40 mg are undesirable. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects \\nDeficiency: \\nThe clinical features of severe zinc deficiency in humans are growth retardation, delayed sexual and bone maturation, sk in \\nlesions, diarrhea, alopecia (loss of hair or baldness), impaired appetite, increased susceptibility to infections mediated vi a \\ndefects in the immune syst em, and the appearance of behavioral changes. The central role of zinc in cell division, protein \\nsynthesis and growth is especially important for infants, children, adolescents and pregnant women; these groups suffer \\nmost from an inadequate zinc intake. Zi nc-responsive stunting has also been identified in several studies. Even though zinc \\nis an essential requirement for a healthy body, too much zinc can be harmful. \\nToxicity:  \\nGross acute zinc toxicity has been reported after consuming water stored in galvanized containers. S ymptoms include \\nnausea, vomiting and fever. These symptoms are observed after ingestion of 2g or more of zinc. Long -term zinc intakes'),\n",

Copper seems to be \\nespecially sensitive to high zinc doses. Intakes between 25 -50 mg zinc per day have been reported to interfere with \\nmetabolism of both iron and copper. FAO/NHO 200 4 therefore recommended the upper level of zinc intake for an adult \\nman at 45 mg/day.  \\n3.3.5.3 COPPER \\nFrom very early times, copper compounds were used to treat various diseases. It is now known that copper is a constituent \\nof several enzymes and proteins,  most of which catalyze oxidation reduction reactions. In the body, copper occurs in two \\noxidation states- Cu\" (Cuprous) or Cu2+ (Cupric). The body of a healthy adult contains a little over 0.1 g of copper w ith \\nconcentration being high in liver, brain, hea rt, bone, hair and nails. About 25 % of body copper is present in muscle, and \\n42% in the skeleton. \\n\\uf0b7 Food sources of Copper: \\nGreen leafy vegetables, nuts, legumes, dried fruits, muscle meats and shellfish especially oysters are foods containing more \\nthan 1 m g copper per 1000 kilocalories. Copper though present in small amounts in the food needs to be absor bed, \\ntransported, stored and excreted efficiently so as to be able to perform its host of functions some of which are critical for  \\nother metabolic functions in our body. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions of copper: \\nCopper serves as a co -factor, as well as, an allosteric component of enzymes. In many enzymes copper functions as an \\nintermediate in electron transfer. Copper appears to influence gene expression through binding to specific transcription \\nfactors. In some cases, copper has been shown to influence transcription by binding to transcription  factor, which in turn \\nbinds to promoter sequence of DNA. \\nAbsorption, storage and excretion: \\nIn food, most copper is present as Cu2+ and some as Cu+. This copper is bound to organic compounds especially protein. \\npepsin and some proteolytic enzymes aid in the release of copper. Released copper forms soluble comp lexes with amino \\nacids, organic acids and other chelators which are readily absorbed mainly in the upper intestinal tract. Some copper is also \\nabsorbed from the stomach; Once copper is within the intestinal cell, it may be used by the cell, may be stored in the cell or \\nmay be transported across the basolateral membrane. Most absorb ed copper is secreted by the liver into the bile to be \\nexcreted jn the feces. This process is the major regulator of copper elimination. Only small amount of copper (10-50 mcg) is \\nexcreted through kidney. Thus, the absorption and excretion process of coppe r helps in maintaining optimum levels of this \\nelement in our body so that it can help in performing a number of metabolic reactions in the body.  \\n\\uf0b7 Nutritional requirements: \\nSafe and adequate range for copper intake is 1.5-3 mg/day. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects: \\nDeficiency: \\nThe predisposing factors of copper deficiency are prematurity, low birth weight and malnutrition, especially when \\ncombined with feeding practices such as cow\\'s milk or total parenteral nutrition. The most frequent symptoms are anemia, \\nneutropenia (abnormally high levels of a type of WBC\\'s in blood) and bone fractures. Other less frequent symptoms include \\nhypo-pigmentation, impaired growth, and an increased incidence of infections and abnormalities of glucose and cholesterol \\nmetabolism. \\nToxicity \\nAcute copper toxicity in humans is rare and occurs due to inadvertent consumption of copper salts. Symptom s include \\nvomiting, diarrhea, hemolytic anemia, renal and liver damage. Clinical symptoms of chronic copper to xicity appear when \\nthe capacity for protective copper binding in the liver is exceeded which include jaundice, hepatitis and liver cirrhosis.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"67 \\n \\nApart from an abnormally high or low intake, copper imbalance in various tissues may also develop as  a consequence of \\ngenetic disturbances in the metabolism of copper. The most important one's being the Menke's and the Wilson's disease. \\n3.3.5.4 SELENIUM \\nSelenium is a non metallic element and exists in several oxidation states which include Se2+,S e4+an d Se6+.T he chemistry \\nof selenium is similar to that of sulphu r. Total selenium content of the body varies from 3 -15 mg depending on the dietary \\nintake. Approximately 30% of tissue selenium is contained in the liver, \\n15% in kidney, 30% in muscle and 10% in blood plasma. \\n\\uf0b7 Food Sources of selenium: \\nEnvironmental conditions and agricultural practices have a profound influence on the selenium content of many foods. \\nSelenium enters the food chain through plants. The concentration of selenium in plants is directly r elated to the \\nconcentration of the mineral in the soil on wh ich plants were grown. Among the different trace elements, selenium varies \\ngreatly in its soil concentration. The absorption of selenium by plants is not only dependent on the  concentration of \\nselenium in the soil but also on pH, microbial activity, rainfall and the chemical form of selenium. Owing to all above factors, \\nthe selenium content in food varies greatly. Overall, animal products, especially organ meats, are t hought to contain more \\nselenium than plant sources \\nUntil recently, the only known metaboli c role of selenium in humans was as a component of glutathione peroxidase which \\nalong with vitamin E and superoxide dismutase forms a part of the antioxidant defense system. Seleno proteins in animals \\nand humans are involved in protection from oxidative dam age, maintaining adequate thyroid hormone status and \\nprotection from injury by a heavy metal like mercury. \\nSelenium compounds' are generally very efficiently absorbed by humans and selenium absorption does n ot appear to be' \\nunder homeostatic control. Selen ium is mainly absorbed from the duodenum. Less absorption occurs in the jejunum and \\nileum. In addition, some dietary factors appear to influence the absorption of the element. Phytates and heavy metals, such \\nas mercury through chelation and precipitation, hinder selenium absorption. Vitamins C, A and E, as well as, glutathione \\nenhance the absorption. Selenium is excreted from the body almost equally in the urine (as methyl se lenium) and feces \\n(unabsorbed selenium, biliary, pancreatic and intestinal secretio n). Unlike copper, selenium is rapidly excreted in urine. \\nSelenium losses through lungs and skin also contribute to daily selenium excretion. \\n\\uf0b7 Nutritional requirements: \\nIn the U.S., recommended nutrient intake is 70 mcg/day for men and 55 mcg/day for women. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects: \\nDeficiency \\nSelenium deficiency has been linked to two regional human diseases: Keshan disease and Kashin Beck's disease.  \\nKeshan disease: It is a cardiomyopathy (disease of the myocardium, involving heart  muscle) that was identified to affect \\nchildren and women of child bearing age in China. \\nKashin Beck disease: Kashin Beck disease was identified to affect growing children in parts of Siberian Russia and China.  It \\nis characterized by osteoarthritis involving degeneration and necrosis of the joints and epiphyseal -plate cartilages of legs \\nand arms. \\nToxicity \\nThere is a narrow margin between the beneficial and harmful intakes of selenium. The level at which selenosis occurs is not \\nwell-defined but threshold for toxicity appears to be 850 -900 microgram per day. Symptoms of chronic toxicity include \\nbrittle hair and nails, skin lesions with secondary infections and garlic odor in the breath.\"),\n",

Chromium supplementation is kn own to improve \\nimpaired glucose tolerance. Like other elements, Chromium also exists in several oxidation states fr om Cr2 - to Cr 6+ \\nhowever Cr3+ or the trivalent form is the biologically important one. \\n\\uf0b7 Food Sources \\nLike we know, chromium occurs in trivalent form in foods. Good sources of chromium include whole gra ins, spices and \\ncondiments, meats especially organ meats, mushrooms, cheese, prunes and tea. Brewer's yeast has a hi gh content of \\nbiologically active organi cally complexed form known as the Glucose Tolerance Factor (GTF). Chromium forms complexes \\nwith nicotinic acid and amino acids to form GTF. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions \\nActive chromium as GTF potentiates the action of insulin and thus influences carbohydrate, lipid and insulin metabolism. \\n1. Role in Insulin Formation:  chromium activates the 'insulin receptor tyrosine kinase' and inhibits the 'insulin receptor \\ntyrosine phosphatase which leads to an increased phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, which is a ssociated with \\nincreased insulin sensitivity. Since chromium improves insulin function, it is suggested that chromium may play a role in \\nglucose and lipid metabolism. \\n2. Role in Glucose, Lipid and Nucleic Acid Metabolism: Chromium leads to a decrease in blood glucose concentration in \\npeople with elevated glucose levels and an increase in those with low blood glucose levels. It shows no effect in the \\nsubjects with normal blood glucose levels. \\nOverall, chromium appears to reduce levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides in blood and increase \\nlevel of HDL cholesterol. \\nAnother proposed role for chromium is in relation to nucleic acid metabolism. It is postulated that Cr3+ is involved in \\nmaintaining the structural integrity of nuclear strands and in the regulation of gene expression. \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and excretion: \\nChromium appears to be absorbed throughout the small intestine, with absorption being higher in jeju num. The \\nmechanism of absorption involves simple diffusion and other processes. As compared to healthy indivi duals, insulin -\\ndependent diabetic patients absorb 2 -4 times more chromium. It appears that these patients have an impaired ability to \\nconvert inorganic form to usable form and therefore require higher chromium. \\nAfter absorption, chromium binds to plasma proteins for transportation. Both tr ansferring and albumin are capable of \\nbinding absorbed Cr. Although transferrin and albumin play the major roles in transportation, other plasma proteins such as \\nalpha and beta globulins and lipoproteins are also involved. It appears that absorbed inorgani c chromium is transported to \\nthe liver, which is postulated to be the possible site for synthesis of metabolically active molecule. This molecule is held in a \\nbody pool and released as needed. \\nMost ingested chromium is excreted in feces. Inorganic chromium  is excreted primarily by the kidney, with small amounts \\nbeing excreted through hair, sweat and bile. Organically bound chromium is excreted through bile. \\n\\uf0b7 Nutritional requirements: \\nThere is no Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for chromium but adequate i ntakes that can be used as a goal for \\nindividual intakes has been proposed by the Food Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Services , USA. An adult male \\nand female require up to 30 and 20 microgram per day. During pregnancy and lactation chromium needs increase to 30 and \\n45 micrograms per day respectively.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='69 \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects: \\nDeficiency: \\nMarginal chromium deficiency leads to impaired glucose tolerance. Individuals receiving TPN without chromium have been \\nshown to develop symptoms of deficiency such as imp aired glucose tolerance with high blood glucose level and glucose \\nexcretion in urine. Peripheral neuropathy has also been reported which was reversed with chromium su pplementation. \\nChromium deficiency results in insulin resistance characterized by hyperinsulinemia. Hyperinsulinemia is implicated as a risk \\nfactor for coronary heart disease. \\nToxicity \\n\\' Trivalent chromium, the form of chromium found in foods and supplements, is least toxic. Oral supple ments up to 800 to \\n1000 mcg per day appear to be safe. Cr6+  on the other hand can be highly toxic. Inhalation of Cf\" may result in respiratory \\ndisease while direct contact results in dermatitis and skin ulceration and sometimes liver damage. \\n3.3.5.6 MANGANESE \\nIn living tissues, manganese is found in the + 2, +3 and +4 oxidation states. An adult man is estimated to contain 10 -20 mg \\nof the metal, with 25% of the total body stores in the skeleton. In addition, the rest is present in liver, pancreas and \\nintestine. \\n\\uf0b7 Food Sources \\nThe food sources of manganese are whole cereals, nuts; leafy vegetables and tea. Diets high in foods of plant origin provide \\nan average 8.3 mg of manganese per day. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions \\nLike other microminerals, Mn also functions in mammalian enzyme systems. It can function both as an integral part of \\nmetalloenzymes and as an enzyme activator. \\n1. Antioxidant activity: As Mn is a component of mitochondria (Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), it can protect against \\noxidative damage. \\n2. Carbohydrate metabolism: Mn is required for carbohydrate metabolism. \\n3. Integrity of cartilag e: Mn plays an important role in proteoglycan biosynthesis, which is essential for the integrity of \\ncartilage. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and excretion: \\nIntestinal absorption of Mn occurs throughout the length of the small intestine. Ingested manganese is thought to be \\nconverted into Mn3+ in the duodenum. Studies show that the mucosal uptake could be a rapidly saturab le process, which \\nappears to be mediated by a high-affinity, low-capacity active transport system. Absorption of Mn from the diet is very low. \\nOn the basis of Mn retention, it has been estimated that adult humans absorb 4.8% of ingested manganese. \\nAfter absorption, Mn is complexed with albumin and transported to the liver, which is the key organ in its metabolism. Mn \\nis found in most organs and tissues and preferentially accumulates in the mitochondria. There is no storage form for Mn. \\nBone contains substantial amount of mineral but there is no mechanism to release it and thus bone Mn  is considered as \\npassive storage. \\nMn is almost totally excreted in the feces (92%). Excess absorbed MI is quickly excreted by the liver into the bile to maintain \\nhomeostasis. Only trace amounts are excreted in urine.'),\n",

Majority of Mn toxicity cases have been \\nreported from individuals exposed to airborne Mn in industrial areas in excess of 5 mg per cubic meter. Mn toxicity is a \\nserious health hazard; in its severe form it results in se rious psychiatric symptoms such as hyperirritability, violent acts, \\nhallucinations and poor coordination. Several abnormalities occur in the central nervous system, the  morphological lesions \\nbeing similar to Parkinson's disease. \\n3.3.5.7 IODINE \\nIodine is of  nutritional importance as a constituent of thyroid hormones which are indispensable for normal growt h and \\ndevelopment in humans. Synthesis of the iodine containing thyroid hormones occurs exclusively in the  thyroid gland. The \\nrelation between iodine defic iency and enlargement of the thyroid gland or goiter was found when it was seen that the \\nthyroid gland became hyperplastic or there was an increase in number of normal cells in an organ and therefore an increase \\nin volume or size of the organ with low leve l of iodine in the body.  Iodine is a non -metallic element of the halogen group \\nand it is typically found and functions in its ionic form, iodide (I-'). About 15 -20 mg iodine is found in human body, of which \\n70 -80% is present in the thyroid gland. The thy roid gland weighs 15-25 grams and has a remarkable ability to concentrate \\niodine. In the iodine deficient individual, enlarged thyroid gland may contain only 1 mg iodine. \\n\\uf0b7 Food Sources \\nThe iodine concentration in foods is highly variable and also depends on  the concentration of iodine content of soil in that \\nregion. The amount of iodide in drinking water is an indicator of the iodide content of the rocks an d soils of a region and i t \\nparallels the incidence of iodine deficiency among the inhabitants of that r egion. The iodine present in the upper crust of \\nthe earth is leached by glaciation and repeated flooding, and is carried to the sea. Seawater is, th erefore, a rich source of  \\niodine. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions of Iodine: \\nIodine is an essential constituent of the thyroid hormones: thyroxin (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which have a key role in \\ngrowth and development. \\nThyroid hormone performs multiple functions as regulator of cell activity and growth. The hormone ha s crucial metabolic \\nroles in the fetus and in the infant (p ost-natal).It promotes growth and maturation of peripheral tissues in the human \\nembryo, the most visible effect seen in the skeletal growth. Delayed bone development has been seen in hormone deficient \\nhuman embryos. Thyroid hormone influences neuronal cell  growth and dendrite development in the embryo. A major \\neffect of fetal iodine deficiency is cretinism, characterized by mental deficiency and deaf mutism (defects of hearing and \\nspeech), squint, disorders of stance and gait and stunted growth. Linear grow th, i.e. stature and bone maturation are \\ncritically dependent on thyroid hormone. Both are retarded when there is a deficiency of the hormone  due to low iodide \\nintakes. The hormone plays an important role in the provision of energy to most cells in the bod y; the best indicator of this \\nis the energy available for utilization in the basal state, i.e. the basal metabolic rate. In endemi c iodine deficient region s \\nschool children have been shown to have general IQs 10 points lower than children in non -iodine deficient areas. Reduced\"),\n",

They are necessary for the normal nervous system development and linear growth. Directly or \\nindirectly, most organs are under the influence of these substances. \\nIt is probable that iodine has additional roles to that of thyroid hormones activity, e.g.in antibio tic and anticancer activity, \\nbut these have not yet been researched well. \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and excretion: \\nLike other nutrients, dietary iodide is either found free or bound to amino acids. It is primarily found as iodide or iodate. The \\nlatter form is reduced to  iodide by glutathione in the gut. Iodide is rapidly 'and completely absorbed throughout the \\ngastrointestinal tract and very little iodine appears in feces. After absorption, free iodide appears in the blood and circulates \\nto all tissues. Thyroid gland traps most of the ingested iodide (80%). \\nUnutilized iodide is excreted via kidneys, which forms the major route of iodide excretion (80 -90 %). The urinary output of \\niodide correlates closely with the plasma iodide concentration and has been used to monitor io dide status. Some iodide is \\nalso lost in sweat, especially in the hot tropical regions. \\n\\uf0b7 Nutritional requirements of Iodine: \\nThe minimum amount of iodide to prevent goitre is estimated between 50 and 75 mcg/day or 1 mcg/kg bo dy weight. The \\n1989 ICMR recommended RDA is 150 mcg/day for adults of both sexes. Although the recommendations are the same for \\nboth males and females, iodide needs are higher during pregnancy and lactation and recommended intak es are 175 -200 \\nmcg iodine per day. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects: \\nDeficiency \\nIodine deficiency affects all populations at all stages of life, from the intrauterine stage to old age. However, pregnant \\nwomen, lactating women, women of reproductive age, and children younger than 3 years of age are cons idered the most \\nimportant group s because iodine deficiency occurring during fetal and neonatal growth and development leads to \\nirreversible damage of the brain and central nervous system and, consequently, to irreversible menta l retardation. Mild \\ngoitre, endemic cretinism, hypothyroidis m are c ollective manifestations of iodine deficiency and are termed as 'Iodine \\nDeficiency Disorders' (IDD). \\nApart from cretinism, hypothyroidism and goitre, other features linked to IDD are the decreased fert ility rates, increased \\nstillbirths and spontaneo us abortion rates and increased perinatal and infant mortality. Epidemiological studies have \\nindicated that an ingestion of 100 -200 mg of iodine daily is sufficient to prevent deficiency except among individuals \\nsuffering from a genetic disorder. \\nToxicity \\nOver 2 mg iodine per day for long periods is regarded as excessive or potentially harmful  that are very high in seafood \\nand/or seaweed or comprising foods contaminated with iodine. Iodine -induced thyrotoxicosis (hyperthyroidism) and toxic \\nmodular goiter may result from excess iodine exposure. Hyperthyroidism is largely confined to those over 40 years of age  \\nand symptoms are rapid heart rate, trembling, excessive sweating, lack of sleep, and loss of weight and strength. Individuals \\nwho are sensitive to iodine usually have mild skin symptoms.\"),\n",

Fluorine (F) is a gaseous chemical element, while its ion, fluoride (F) is composed of fluorine bound to \\na metal, non -metal, or an organic compound. Fluoride predominates in nature and in body, it is deposited in bones  and \\nteeth. Its incorporation into tooth enamel markedly increases the hardness and resistance to decay. \\n\\uf0b7 Food Sources \\nThe major source of fluoride in most diets is water, with foods providing only about 25% of total in take. These include tea \\nand marine fish, ready-to-use infant formulas made with fluoridated water. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions of Fluorine: \\nThe only beneficial role demonstrated for fluoride is in reducing the prevalence and severity of dental caries in children and \\nadults. There are three ways in which fluoride may act to prevent tooth decay.  \\nWhen fluoride is incorporated into the tooth early in life at the time of tooth eruption, the enamel  containing fluoroapatite \\nbecomes more resistant to dissolution by acids. Secondly, as the enamel gets demineralized by contact with food acids and \\npresence of fluorine ensures that enamel structure is maintained. Lastly, fluoride inhibits glycolys is and reduces acid \\nformation from sugars on the teeth helping to prevent enamel demineralization and tooth decay. \\n\\uf0b7 Absorption, storage and excretion: \\nSoluble fluorides, even at high intake levels are almost completely absorbed from gastrointestinal t ract. These include \\naqueous solutions of fluorides, sodium fluoride used in toothpastes, and sodiu m fluorosilicate used in water fluoridation. \\nOnce absorbed, the fluoride passes into the blood for distribution chiefly to the calcified tissues.  Most of the ionic fluori de \\nenters the bone and developing teeth. About half of the fluoride absorbed each day is deposited in the skeleton or teeth \\nwithin 24 hours. Nearly 99% of the fluoride in the body is in the calcified tissues. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects: \\nDeficiency: \\nFor the above reasons, fluoride is considered as a beneficial element for humans, but it is not an e ssential element so a \\ndeficiency does not have much effect. Drinking water fluoride levels of 0.7 to1.2 mg/L is considered safe. \\nToxicity \\nFluoride is a cumulative toxin. Ingestion of fluoride 1.0 -1.5 mg/L for several years may produce dental fluorosis, i.e. \\nbrowning and pitting of teeth known as mottling, Chronic high level of fluoride in the range of 2 -5 mgL can cause skeletal \\nfluorosis. The severe forms of skeletal deformity in toxic fluorosis include kyphosis (abnormal curvature of th e spine), fixed \\nspine and other joint deformities. Hyper parathyroidism secondary to high fluoride intake has been reported, which induces \\ncalcification of soft tissues. A form of severe skeletal flourosis known as \"Genuvalgium\" (knocked k nees) has been reported \\nfrom part of India, China and African countries. The condition is characterized by severe skeletal fluorosis and osteo porosis \\nof the limbs. \\n3.4 Other constituents of Food \\nApart from major nutrients like carbohydrates, proteins, fats and minor nutrients like vitamins and minerals, there are \\nsome more constituents of food which help in the digestion, absorption, assimilation of food and nutrients and excretion of \\nwastes from the body. They are water and dietary fibre.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='73 \\n \\n3.4.1    WATER \\nWater comprises about two thirds of the body’s weight, and is the medium or solvent in which almost everybody process \\ntakes place both inside and outside the cells. The need of the body for water is second only to to i ts need for air. One can \\nsurvive for weeks without food but only a few days without water. Water comes from solid foods as well as from drinks and \\nis lost by evaporation in the breath, sweat and urine. The balance of water retained in the body is carefully regulated by the \\nkidneys but excessive is lost during vomiting, diarrhea, strenuous activity or hot climate. In such conditions, water must be \\nimmediately replenished or dehydration may result. In temperate climates, at least 1 liter of water or fluid should be drunk \\nand more if heavy work is done. \\nYou may already know that the total body  water (TBW) constitutes 50-60% of the body weight. The body of a  70 kg adult \\nmale contains 42-liter water - 60% of his body weight while the body of an adult female contains 55% water. This difference \\nin both sexes is due to a higher fat content found in females. Similarly muscular people have a higher proportion of water \\nthan the less muscular or obese people. This is because the striated muscle contains more water than any other body tissue \\n(except blood). As we, age we notice that there is a steady fall  in the proportion of water which is due to an increased \\ndeposition of fat in the body, as well as, loss of muscle mass with age. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions of Water \\n1. Water as a medium and solvent: Water is the medium of all cell fluids, including digestive juices, lymph, blood, urine, \\nand perspiration. All the physiochemical reactions that occur in the cells of the body take place in  the precisely \\nregulated environment of the body fluids. Water enters into many essential reactions, such as hydrolysis, that occurs in \\ndigestion. Water is an end product in the oxidation of energy-yielding nutrients. \\n2. Water as a lubricant: All fluids have lubricating as they can make it easier for the solid materials to slip over one \\nanother. Water-based fluids act as lubricants in various parts  of the body, most notably within joints where synovial \\nfluid makes movements easier and minimizes wear and tear in cartilage and bone. \\n3. Water as a temperature regulator: Water plays an important role in the distribution of heat throughout the body and \\nthe regulation of body temperature. Heat is generated in the body due to hard work, exposure to heat, fever or merely \\nby the metabolism of energy -yielding nutrients. The most effective route of heat loss from the body is via the \\nevaporation of water as perspiration from the surface of the skin. \\n4. Water as a source of dietary minerals: Though water is composed of only oxygen and hydrogen, the water we drink or \\nuse in food preparation can contain significant amounts of minerals, such as calcium, magnesium, zin c, co pper and \\nfluoride; the amount will vary based on the source of water and any treatment the water has been put  through. While \\nhard water will contain magnesium and calcium, the soft water may contain sodium. \\n \\nWater distribution in the body: \\nWithin the body, water is found in two major compartments. These are: . \\n\\uf0b7 The intracellular compartment (inside the cell) \\n\\uf0b7 The extracellular compartment (outside the cell). \\nThe intracellular puid or the water within the cells makes up about 40-45% of the total body weight. Because the body cells \\nare the sites of vast metabolic  activity, it is of no surprise that the total water inside the body cells is about  twice the \\namount outside the cells. These are high in potassium and magnesium and low in sodium and chloride ions. \\nThe extracellular fluid compartment is further subdivided into several smaller compartments as you may have noticed in \\nFigure 6.2. These include: \\n\\uf0b7 Plasma \\n\\uf0b7 The intravascular fluid compartment, and \\n\\uf0b7 The intercellular [interstitial or extra vascular fluid (ISF)] compartment. \\n\\uf0b7 The transcellular fluid compartment \\nThe movement of water is controlled mainly by osmotic pressure generated by the inorganic ions in so lution in the body.  \\nOsmotic pressure refers to the pressure exerted by water or solvents flowing into a soluti on at the cell membrane. The \\nosmotic pressure  of the intracellular fluid is the function of its content of potassium, the predominant  cation in the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"74 \\n \\nintracellular fluid. By contrast, the osmotic  pressure of extracellular fluid may be considered relative to its content of \\nsodium, the major cation present in extracellular fluid. Variations in the distribution of  sodium and potassium ions are the \\nprincipal causes of water shifts between the various compartments, \\nWATER BALANCE \\nThe amount of fluid in the body is tightly controlled because imbalance can be \\ndevastating. In a normal individual, the maintenance of water balance is achieved by adjusting both water intake and \\nexcretion as needed. \\nWater Intake \\nThe, major sources of water are: \\n1. The preformed water that we consume as water or as beverage. This will include both preformed water in fluids \\nand in food.  Foods (other than water and beverages) are the second most important sources of water for the \\nbody. Most foods contain 50% water, but milk has the highest amount of water. Fruits and vegetables rank next to \\nmilk, while fats and oils do not contain any water, The water contained in cookies, cakes and chocol ates are \\nrelatively low. This entire group contributes to 25 -30% of daily water intake. This may also be refer red to as \\npreformed water in foods. \\n2. Water that arises from oxidation of foods within the body, which is referred to as water of oxidation or metabolic \\nwater. Water which comes from the oxidation of food is the last source of water. 1 g of starch yields 0.6  g of \\nwater; 1 g of protein 0.41g; and 1 g of fat gives 1.07 g of water. This source contributes only about 10% of the total \\nwater input. This is also known as water of oxidation or metabolic waste. \\nWater Output (Losses of body water) \\nWater is lost from the body by the four routes, namely kidneys (renal system), skin, lungs and intestine. \\n1. Renal loss: Normal adult kidneys excrete about 1-2 liters of urine daily. The \\nwater in this total volume is made up of two portions: obligatory and facultative. \\n2. Skin: The water loss from the skin is through perspiration, which could be \\ninsensible and /or visible. \\n3. Intestine: A small quantity of water (about 100 -200 ml) is normally lost in feces, but this can exceed 5 L in \\ndiarrhoea1 episodes. \\n4. Lungs: The air expired from th e lungs also contains water. Any condition that would increase the rate of \\nrespiration. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Nutritional requirements for water \\nThe body has no provision for water storage; therefore, the amount of water lost every 24 hours must  be replaced to \\nmaintain health and body efficiency. The precise need for water depends on a person's body weight and lifestyle. a \\nreasonable allowance based on recommended energy intake is 1.0 ml / Kcal for adults and 1.5 ml / Iccal for infants. This \\ntranslates into: \\n- 35 ml/ kg in adults \\n- 50 - 60 ml/ kg in children \\n- 150 ml / kg in infants\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='75 \\n \\nInfants have an increased need for water because of the limited capacity of their kidneys to handle the renal solute load, \\ntheir higher percentage of body water and large surface area per unit of body  weight. Exercise, high temperature, low \\nhumidity, high altitude and a high fibre diet increase fluid needs. Alcoholic beverages and those co ntaining caffeine such as \\ncoffee, tea and sodas, however, are not good substitutes for water; both alcohol and caff eine act as diuretics, causing the \\nbody to lose fluids. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects \\nThe correct functioning of cells and tissues depends on appropriate concentrations of nutrients; so any abnormal loss or \\naccumulation of fluid can cause a variety of problems.  \\nDehydration: \\nDehydration is defined as the excessive loss of body water. It may occur because of inadequate intake, or abnormal loss of \\nbody water or a combination of both. The symptoms of dehydration are : \\n\\uf0b7 Thirst \\n\\uf0b7 Loss of appetite \\n\\uf0b7 Decreased urination \\n\\uf0b7 Impaired physical performance \\n\\uf0b7 Nausea \\n\\uf0b7 Impaired temperature regulation \\n\\uf0b7 Muscle spasms \\n\\uf0b7 Increased pulse rate \\n\\uf0b7 Increased respiration rate \\n\\uf0b7 General debilitation \\nWith water loss in excess of 10% of body weight, there is a possibility of cardiovascular failure ca used by a  reduction in \\nblood pressure and a compensating increase in the heart rate. People for whom water losses may be ac companied by \\nsignificant losses of sodium include those engaged in strenuous physical activity of any sort, those  exposed to high \\nenvironmental temperatures at work, and visitors to tropical regions who are unaccustomed to heat. Such people, and in \\ngeneral anyone loosing in excess may need small amounts of salt along with the fluid they drink to i ntake up their sodium \\nloss. One other situation that demands extra fluid for the body is a long airplane flighl; a traveler can lose approximalely 1.5 \\nlitres of water during a 3-hour flight chiefly due to increased in sensible perspiration. The dehumidified air in the airplane is \\nso dry that excessive \\'i nsensible\\' perspiration and evaporation occur. Athletes in good physical condition experience a \\nreduction in athletic performance if they lose 3% of body water. Reduction of as little as 2% of tot al body water causes a \\ndecline of 20 to 30% in efficiency at  work. Fluid loss secondary to diarrhea has been responsible for thousands of deaths of \\nchildren in developing countries. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT).with a simple mixture of water, sal ts and sugar has been \\nhighly effective in reducing the number of deaths. \\nOedema \\nIn some pathological conditions, the body is in a positive water balance; that is the intake of flui ds is greater than the \\nexcretion, and the patient is said to have edema.  Oedema results when the body water is increased to the levels of 10% or  \\nmore above normal. Kwashiorkor, a dietary protein deficiency in PEM, Nephrotic syndrome, Congestive cardiac failure (CCF) \\nand cirrhosis of the liver are conditions when oedema is seen. Low or loss of plasma proteins, distu rbance in sodium \\nexcretion are causes of water retention or oedema  in the body. \\n3.4.2 DIETARY FIBRE: \\nSome foods particularly cereals and some fruits and vegetables, contain substantial amounts of dietary fibre or roughage. In \\ncontrast to other nutrients, this mixture of indigestible mate rials is not absorbed into the body; instead it adds bulk to the \\nfeces. This property is beneficial to health. In other words \"Dietary fibre is the edible part of plants or analogous \\ncarbohydrates that are resistant to digestion and absorption in the human  small intestine with complete or partial \\nfermentation in the large intestine. Dietary fibre includes polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, ligni n and associated plant \\nsubstances. Metabolic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, as well as, the d iseases which were a result of \\nstraining at stool such as diverticular disease, hiatus hernia and hemorrhoids are a result of low fiber in the diet.'),\n",

It forms a stiff  jelly when cooked. It is  \\nnot fibrous and is completely digested and has little effect on feces (unlike dietary fibre), yet it is often considered as a part \\nof dietary fibre. \\n\\uf0b7 Functions: \\nDietary fibre has major effects on: \\na) Satiety: Ingestion of a high fibre food induces a feeling of satiety, reduces meal size and food intake. \\nb) Nutrient Absorption: Inclusion of fibre has been shown to retard the absorption of some nutrients. The inclusion of \\nviscous polysaccharides reduces the postprandial glucose level concentration. \\nc) Integrity of gut/colon: Dietary fibre especially fermentable fibres, play an important role in maintaining the integrity of \\ngut. \\nd) Stool weight and laxation: The amount of stool excreted varies markedly from individual to individual and in an \\nindividual over a period of time. \\n\\uf0b7 Recommended Intake of Fibre: \\nAn intake of 10 -13 g dietary fibre intake per 1000 Kcal also has been suggested by American dietary association and an \\nupper limit of 35 g/day. \\n\\uf0b7 Health aspects: \\nDietary fibre plays a protective role against chronic degenerative diseases  like colon cancer and cardiovascular diseases. \\nFurther, fiber has been shown to lower serum estrogen concentrations, and therefore may have a prote ctive effect against \\nhormone-related cancers. Recent studies have shown a decreased risk of endometrial canc er, ovarian cancer, and prostate \\ncancer with high fiber intakes. \\nThus, dietary fibre is now .recognized as important component of diet and plays an important role in  gastrointestinal \\nphysiology and has a number of potential health benefits. \\n 3.5  Let us sum up: \\n\\uf0b7 We learnt that vitamins and minerals are vital to the body functions even if they are needed in very  small amounts. \\nVitamins are categorized into fat soluble and water soluble vitamins. Fat -soluble vitamins i.e, Vita A, D, E, and K. can be \\nobtained from dairy products and also inexpensive, readily available plant foods and sunlight. A table below s ummarizes \\nthe important functions and sources of fat -soluble vitamins. We learnt that the deficiencies of these vitamins are of public \\nhealth significance and should be addressed to immediately. \\n\\uf0b7 Water-soluble vitamins comprise of vitamins of the B complex group and vitamin C.

All these macro minerals constitute an important part of our daily diet and pe rform both structural \\nand metabolic functions in the body. Most minerals support the activity of specific enzymes and are thus involved in \\ncatalytic function. However, Na and K majorly function by changing their location i.e., from one side of plasma membr ane \\nto other. Regulation occurs either at the level of absorption or excretion or storage.

In this uni t, \\nwe shall learn as to how much of each nutrient we would need to maintain optimum health. This is kno wn as \\nrecommended dietary Intake (RDI) and is laid down by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). \\nRecommended dietary intake of individuals varies according to age, sex and physical and medical cond itions. Therefore, \\ndiets have to be designed to provide for optimum nutri tion. Such diets are called balanced diets. A balanced diet provides \\nfor the energy necessary for the body to function and all nutrients in right proportions for bodybui lding, repair and \\nprotection against diseases.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='88 \\n \\nIn order to plan a balanced diet, it is not possible for us to count the calories and weight of each nutrient every day. Hence, \\nwith lot of research, experts have found out the kinds of food and their nutritional values which we need to take in our daily \\ndiet. They have translated the calories and amount of nutrients into portions so that it is easy for us to plan a balanced \\nmeal. This is also known as the food guide wherein foods are grouped according to the nutrients they provide.  \\nThis guide helps in food selection and ensures good nutrition on a daily basis. \\nMenu planning is a creative activity and generally requires some intelligent thinking and manipulation. This is because apart \\nfrom the influence of age and sex of an individual, his/her physique, physiological condition, level  of physical  activity also \\neffects the requirements of nutrients to the body. Climatic conditions, growth and pathological stre ss play an important \\nrole in nutritional demands of the body. All these factors have to be taken into consideration while  planning a menu for an \\nindividual.  \\nUnlike balanced diet where foods are grouped for easy usage, meal planning involves the application of dietary knowledge \\nof nutrients as exchange list; interaction of nutrients with each other and other technical know how  to plan a meal fo r an \\nindividual. This is especially beneficial for people with any medical disorder or pathological stress. \\n4.2 The Indian RDI \\nThere were several reasons for setting up the RDIs. Long back in 1936 it was found that the effects of deficient diets were \\ndrastic, so countries in the League of Nations set up a committe e to recommend daily dietary  allowances for each of the \\nknown nutrients. Later during the Second World War, many recruits were rejected from the army, as th ey were \\nunderweight. The governments in v arious countries were shocked with the rate of rejection and anxious to change this \\nsituation. They formed an Expert Committees to set up Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) to guide  people to meet \\ntheir nutritional needs and their daily requirements of food. Thus, the RDAs were set up in various countries between 1940 \\nand 1944.  \\nOver the years, these recommendations had to be revised based on newer research findings. In India, major revisions were \\nmade in 1958, 1968 and 1981. The 1981 revision is entitled Recommended Dietary Intakes (RDIs) for Indians. The name has \\nbeen revised to emphasize intake. These values are not final and will be revised as and when there a re new research \\nfindings. \\nWhen RDIs were laid down for India and provision for adequate amoun ts of nutrients to the body was thought of then it \\nwas necessary to express the age and body dimension of the person. This was to ensure that all perso ns would meet their \\nnutrient needs. Therefore, one representative person was chosen whose age and body si ze was defined. Therefore, the \\nthought of a reference man and a reference woman came into being. \\nA reference man is of age 20-39 years, weighs approximately 55 kgs whereas a reference woman is of age 20-39 years, and \\nweighs 45 kgs. \\nRefer to table no.4.2 for RDIs for Indian adults \\n The Recommended dietary intakes are given for:- \\n1. Energy \\n2. Proteins \\n3. Minerals--Calcium and iron \\n4. Vitamins-Water soluble- (vitamin C and vitamin B- thiamine, riboflavin and niacin) \\n5. Vitamins-Fat soluble-(vitamins A and D) \\nOur body needs only two nutrients in large amounts –Energy in kilocalories and proteins in grams.  \\n1. Energy: RDIs for energy are with reference to average or reference weights. Although there is normally no need for \\nadjustment for groups of different weights, there is evidence that average energy intakes are now lower perhaps in \\nrelation to our reduced energy expenditure. \\n2. Protein: The RDIs for protein represent 10 per cent of the energy requirement (ex. For a pregnant woman, 60g of \\nprotein provides 240 kcal, which is 10  percent of her total requirement of 2400 kcal.)Our need for protein is about 1'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='89 \\n \\ngm per kg body weight. Therefore, the protein RDI for the reference man is 55 gm and the reference woman is 45 gm. \\nIt should however be noted that if energy requirements are not fully met at the same time, that protein which is eaten \\nwill be utilized more to provide the needed energy than for growth and tissue repair. \\n3. Fat and carbohydrate: There appears to be no absolute dietary requirement for either fat or carbohydrate except for \\na small amount (1 -2 per cent of energy requirement) of essential fatty acids and some carbohydrates (50 -100 g/day) \\nare necessary to prevent the undesirable effects that result from extremely high fat diets. \\n \\nHowever in contrast to the recommendations for protein, minerals and vitamins which are designed to ensure that the \\nintakes by different groups of the population are high enough for health, a number of bodies in deve loped countries have \\nsuggested dietary guidelines to restrict intakes of fat, sugar s and alcohol. This is because there is growing concern that \\nsome individuals are obtaining too much of these nutrients (and not enough dietary fibre). \\n1. Calcium and Iron: Both recommendations allow for the limited absorption of these nutrients from the diet. \\n2. Niacin and Vitamin A: The intakes recommended allow for the likely contributions made by tryptophan and carotenes \\nto the pre-formed nicotinic acid and retinol intakes respectively. \\n3. Vitamin C: There are differing opinions as to the quantity of vitamin C r equired for health. It is generally agreed that \\n10 mg daily will not only prevent but also cure scurvy. The recommended intake of 30 mg is thought t o provide a \\nreasonable safety margin; there is no nutritional advantage from enormously higher intakes altho ugh there may be \\nsome pharmacological action. \\n4. Vitamin D: It is not possible to make firm estimates of dietary needs because most of our requirements are met by \\nvitamin D formed from the action of sunlight on a substance present in the skin. The amounts rec ommended may be \\nconsidered as a safety measure for those who are little exposed to sunlight. \\nExcessive intakes of many of the minerals can be harmful, as can excessive intakes of some of the vi tamins especially \\nvitamin A and D which accumulate in the liver . Such intakes are unlikely to arise from food but may result from excess use \\nof mineral and vitamin supplements. Thus, when RDIs are expressed in daily terms, it is not necessary for the diet to contain \\nthese quantities every day. It is sufficient if the requirements are met over a period of, let us say, a week. \\nBesides these, there are other nutrients, which our body needs. No specific recommendations were mad e about any of \\nthese because when we plan a meal (a good mixed diet), not only our need for the a bove nutrients from natural foods are \\nprovided for but they will also provide enough of all other nutrients also. To ensure that the recom mended intakes cover \\ndifferences in needs of healthy persons, a liberal margin of safety is provided. \\nEnergy requirements are different from other nutrients as appetite normally controls the intake and keeps it close t o its \\nrequirements and intakes in excess of requirements are undesirable and may lead to obesity. The recommendation for each \\ngroup of people is therefore set at its estimated average requirement. \\n4.2.1  Changes in RDI with age and activity \\nIt is natural that nutrient needs vary with age. Table 2.2 gives the RDIs for two major nutrients -energy and protein, for \\nvarious stages of life. We notice that there is a  progressive increase in need for nutrients with age from birth to \\nadolescence. Babies grow very fast in the first year. That is why the recommendations for the first year are given per kilo of \\nbody weight. When children become adolescents, there is rapid growth between 10-15 years, then the growth spurt.  \\nGirls grow faster than boys do during this period. Therefore, the recommendations of energy for girl s of 10 -12 years are \\nhigher than in later years. Once they reach the adult stage, the growth, developmen t of the body is nearly complete, and \\nnutrients are needed only for maintenance and repair. Thus, the requirement of adults is lower than that of adolescents. \\nBesides age, requirements vary with the kind of physical work or activity we are engaged in . As there are innumerable \\nhuman activities with varying energy needs, the experts have broadly divided these into three groups: \\n1. Sedentary worker - a sedentary person is someone who does most of the work sitting in one place and uses only \\nhands and head. A n executive, writer, typist, clerk, teacher, or a homemaker who has household help is examples of \\nsedentary workers. \\n2. Moderate worker  - a moderately active person is someone who uses the muscles of hands and feet fast and \\ncontinuously. Postal workers, house cleaners, gardeners, factory workers, waiters in hotels, farmers and homemakers \\nwho do housework themselves are examples of moderate workers.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"90 \\n \\n3. Heavy worker- a very active person is involved in heavy work if he uses most of the body muscle and moves quite fast \\nfor several hours each day. R ickshaw pullers, loaders, coolies, miners, workers in heavy construction work belong to \\nthis group and it includes sportsmen who practice active sports. \\nRefer to table no.4.2.1a for changes in RDIs with age. \\nRefer to table no.4.2.1b for changes in RDIs with activity. \\n4.2.2 RDIs for pregnancy and lactation \\nBesides age and activity, there is an increase in need for nutrients in  conditions like pregnancy and lactation. We can see \\nthat in the RDIs for these categories in Table. As we are aware, more than three-fourth of the growth of the fetus occurs in \\nthe second half of pregnancy.  Therefore, the recommendations for the additional needs are given for the second half  of \\npregnancy. Allowances for pregnancy or lactation are in addition to the normal needs of a woman as discussed earlier. \\nThe RDIs are highest in the first six months of lactation, because the mother feeds the infant with her milk. By the time, the \\ninfant reaches six months of age, the mother's mi lk supply decreases. We notice that the recommendations for this stage \\nand after this are eventually reduced. \\n Refer to table no.4.2.2 for RDIs for pregnancy and lactation. \\n4.2.3 Uses of RDI \\nRecommended dietary intakes were set to meet a particular need. They have several important uses like: \\n1. They can enable the government to predict food needs of the population, \\n2. They help plan supplementary feeding programs for mothers and children. \\n3. They guide agricultural planning, \\n4. They decide policy of import and export of food, \\n5. They help large catering establishments such as hostels, hospitals to calculate foods to be ordered for \\ntheir inmates, \\n6. They help organize food supply for defense personnel etc.  \\n \\n4.3 Balanced Diet \\nThe provision of palatable and acceptable meals must be the first consideration; only within this framework can planning \\nfor good nutrition be effective. \\nA balanced meal is one that provides adequate amounts of protein and of all the minerals and vitamins as well as energy. It \\nshould also provide dietary fibre, and should be limited in its fat, sugar and salt contents- particularly if these are likely to be \\namply supplied from other sources during the day. At least one balanced mal should be eaten every day. \\nMost foods contain a wide variety of common foods. Thus, the simplest way to meet nutritional standards is to eat a varied \\ndiet containing a wide selection of different types of food. \\n4.3.1 Concept and components \\nExperience and custom have influenced food choice in such a way that traditional meals ar e generally nutritionally \\nsatisfactory as well as good to eat; nevertheless to be sure that this is maintained, now that we re ly to a greater extent on  \\nsnacks and convenience foods, certain general rules can be followed: \\n1. Each meal should contain some foods  rich in protein, such as meat, poultry, fish, cheese, eggs, milk, bread or other \\ncereal product, nuts, peas or beans. \\n2. Each main meal should contain plenty of fruit and vegetables, which are good sources of vitamins and  minerals not \\ncommonly found in other foods.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"91 \\n \\n3. Foods rich in energy should be eaten only in amounts, which will satisfy appetite and maintain corre ct body weight. \\nSuch foods include butter and margarine (which also vitamins A and D), bread and other cereals (whic h also provide \\nprotein, minerals, vitamins and dietary fibre) and only then jam, cakes, biscuits and other foods rich in sugar and fat. \\nThe total daily intake of each of the major nutrients that is recommended for groups of people of di fferent ages and \\noccupations. The total amount of fat should not provide more than 35 per cent of the energy in the diet, nor saturated plus \\ntrans fatty acids more than 15 per cent of energy except for small children. By implication, the total carbohydrate in the diet \\nshould provide about 55 per cent of the dietary energy.  \\nIn practice it will be found that certain meals such as traditional Sunday lunch are likely to be ri ch in many nutrients where \\nas others including breakfasts for many  people will proof a counter balance. It is the total nutrie nt intake over at least one \\nday and preferably a week, that should be assessed and even then, it is the adequacy of the diet in the longer term that is \\nimportant for health.  \\n 4.4 Food groups \\nAll these foods, which form a part of our food pattern, are divided into five food groups in the dai ly food guide for India. As \\nwe may observe, the first column in the table indicates the food group, the second column gives the foods included in the \\ngroup, the third column specific the amount, which gives the size of the serving of each food, and the last  column indicates \\nthe minimum number of servings to be taken to meet one's nutritional needs. If sufficient amounts of food from each of the \\nfive groups ar e included in the day's diet, the nutrient needs of the body will be met. Such a diet is a balanced diet, as it \\nmeets the nutritional needs of the body. \\nLet us study each of the food groups in detail and understand how it is used in practice.  \\nRefer to table no.4.4 for the food group guide. \\n 4.4.1 The cereals-millets group-1 \\nThis group includes preparations of rice, wheat, jowar, bajra, maize, ragi and their products such as rawa (suji or semolina), \\nrice flakes (poha), sevian (vermicelli), daliya (broken  cereals) etc.. The foods from this group provide more than half the \\nday's needs of our body for energy and proteins. In addition, these foods can be a valuable source o f one of the B vitamins-\\nthiamine and the mineral iron, especially if the preparation is  made from unrefined wheat flour. Chapattis made from \\nwhole wheat flour contain six times as much thiamine as bread made from the same amount of maida (refined wheat \\nflour). Parboiled rice contains more thiamine than milled, polished rice. \\n1. Size of one serv ing Any preparation made from 25 gm of any cereal is counted as unit for serving of foods from this \\ngroup. This is equal to half a katori of cooked rice, one medium chapati, two to three puries, half of a medium bhakari, \\ntwo slices of bread, two tablespoons of rice flakes (dry, not soaked) or ready-to-eat cereals. \\n2. Suggested number of servings: A  sedentary person it is suggested to include at least six servings from this group. \\nThose who are moderately active, or are involved in heavy physical work such as l oad-lifting, will need more servings \\nfrom this group. If we If we pursue any hobbies  or sports which involve intense physical work play any games like \\nbadminton, tennis, squash etc., regularly, we will need more servings from this group. \\nTeenagers need mo re servings from this group to meet their need for growth. Expectant mothers in the later half of \\npregnancy need two servings more than their normal intake; while nursing mothers may need four additional servings. \\n 4.4.2 The dal, milk, egg, fish, meat group-2 \\nAll preparations made from dals, whole pulses, milk, eggs, fish, poultry and meat are included in this group.The foods in this \\ngroup are generally used in preparations which are served with cereals. Some preparations, such as i dli, dosa are made by \\ncombining cereals such as rice or rawa (suji) with urad dal; while curd or butter milk are served with rice; egg with toast,and \\nchicken with rice. \\nOne third or more of our protein requirement is provided by these foods. The foods in this group are  good source s of \\nprotein, which is needed for growth and repair of body tissues, e.g. muscles, blood, skin, hair, etc. In addition we meet part \\nof our requirement for minerals and vitamins through these foods. These foods supply part of our B -vitamins requirement \\nalso. Milk, eggs and liver are good sources of vitamin A. Dals, eggs and meat are good sources of iron. Milk is a very good \\nsource of calcium.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"92 \\n \\nSize of one serving: The foods in this group vary in their composition. Therefore, the serving size of each of these varies: \\n1. Dals and whole pulses 25 gm \\n2. Milk or milk preparations 150 gm \\n3. Egg (no.) 1 \\n4. Fish, meat and poultry 25-30 gm \\nOne serving of each of these foods provide 5 to 6 grams of protein. \\nSuggested number of servings: The number varies with age and body size. For example, a child may need only 3 servings, \\nwhereas a teenager may need upto 5 servings.  \\n1. Dals include all types of dals such as chana, moong, urad, masur dal, etc. As we know dal is obtained by removing the \\nseed coat of whole pulse. The whole pulse of legumes such as whole chana, moong, rajma, peas, masur (lentils), \\nmatki (moth beans), Kulthi (horsegram), etc. are all included in this group. We  know that oil seeds  such as \\ngroundnuts and sesame belong to the l egume family and are included in this group. As mentioned earlier any \\npreparation in which 25 gm of any of these foods is used is taken as a serving unit. \\n2. Milk is used as such and in a number of preparations like tea, coffee, buttermilk, curds, basundi, e tc. When we drink \\nmilk or use curd the amount used is easy to note. However, the amount of milk used in preparations v aries. We may \\nuse 15 gm to 25 gm in tea; 30 gm in coffee, a cup of buttermilk may contain 40to 50 gm milk, while a cup of ba sundi \\nmay be ma de from two to two and half cups of milk by concentrating it. Thus, our intake of these needs is to be \\nnoted to get an estimate of total milk intake. An average teacup or 150 ml of milk or a preparation in which 150 ml of \\nmilk is used is counted as one serving. \\n3. We use egg as boiled egg, omelet, in curry, pudding or custard. One medium egg weighs 50 to 52 gm and is counted \\nas one serving. If egg is used in preparation such as pudding, we can estimate the amount we eat by observing the \\nportion we eat. \\n4. When we think of a serving of fish, poultry and meat, include the lean parts (without fat) of the variety th at is eaten. \\nEven organs such as liver, heart and kidney are classified as meat. 20 to 30 gm of fish, poultry or meat can be \\ncounted as a serving. We norma lly buy these by weight. If we note the amount of fatty tissue and bone, we can \\nestimate the amount of lean part per kilogram. When these are served as chops, it is easy to estimat e the weight of \\neach chop and the number of chops eaten to estimate the inta ke. If we make a curry, it is necessary to record total \\namount of curry made and the amount served per person to estimate the intake. Please remember that t he protein \\ncontent of lean meat is less in fatty parts of meat.  \\n 4.4.3 Vegetables and fruits group-3 \\nThe vegetables and fruits we use are divided into two broad groups 3 & 4, according to their nutritional contribution. This \\nmakes it easy to choose the vegetables and fruits which meet the nutritional needs. The third food g roup is made up of \\nprotective vegetables and fruits.  \\nA) Green and Yellow Vegetables and Fruits \\n1. Dark Green leafy vegetables: All dark green leafy vegetables, such as moth (amaranth), palak (spinach), methi \\n(fenugreek), radish leaves, colocasia (alu, arbi) leaves, etc. \\n2. Light green vegetables: Cabbage (gobi), onion tops, etc. \\n3. Yellow vegetables and fruits: Carrot, pumpkin, mango, papaya, orange, apricots etc. \\nAll these vegetables and fruits have one common component, which brings them together in one group -the yellow plant \\npigment beta carotene. This pigment is converted to vitamin A in our body. These vegetables and frui ts are a rich source of \\nthis pigment. One serving of this group provides half or more of our day's need for vitamin A. In ad dition the dark green \\nleafy vegetables contain some vitamin C, minerals and fibre. \\nSize of one serving: Half a katori or 50 gm of cut vegetable or a fruit can be counted as one serving. We need at least one \\nserving every other day (once in two days) from this group. Normally the leafy vegetables are sold as a bunch or in a bundle. \\nThe weight of the bunch varies from 200 to 300 gm. After purchase, the vegetable is sorted to remove damaged leaves and \\ntough stems, thus the edible part is reduced. The amount thus lost varies with the quality and variety of the leafy vegetable \\nselected. A good quality spinach bunch has a high edible portion, being 90-95 per cent. Thus, we can get 4 to 5 servings \\nfrom such a bunch. In other leafy vegetables it may be only 70 per cent. Thus our selection can affect the cost per serving.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"93 \\n \\nWe buy cabbage, carrots, pumpkin by weight. Therefore it is possible to estimate the servings, if we  know the amount \\npurchased. When we buy yellow -orange fruits, we need to estimate the edible portion after deducting the weight of  skin \\nand seeds. \\nThe edible portion varies between 70 to 75 per cent in these fruits. \\nB)   Vitamin C Rich Vegetables and Fruits \\nIn a tropical country like India, we have a variety of vitamin C rich vegetables and fruits. That is  not the case in the \\ntemperate region. For example, the richest source of vitamin C in the tropics is amla (also known as  Indian gooseberry). It \\ncontains ten times as much vitamin C as any citrus fruit. Guavas are another rich source, especially  the newer varieties. \\nApples, cabbage and drumsticks, both leaves and pods are excellent sources of vitamin C. Besides these there a re citrus \\nfruits such as oranges, mosambis, and grape fruits. In addition, papaya, mango, pineapple and tomato are also good sources \\nof vitamin C. \\nSize of one serving: We can take a 50 gm portion, which may fill half a katori, as one serving. It provides half or more of our \\nday's needs for vitamin C. There are some exceptions to this serving size. This happens when we choo se a very \\nconcentrated source. For ex ample, we need only one amla or 15 gm of guava to supply half of our vitamin C requirement \\nfor the day. As .for other fruits, a quarter of a medium orange or musumbi, two segments of grape fruit or a slice of papaya, \\npineapple or mango, or one medium tomato can be counted as one serving. Please remember, a vegetable or fruit, which is \\na good source of both beta-carotene and vitamin C, will take care of both Group 3 (a) and 3 (b) servings. Some examples of \\nthese are orange and papaya, cabbage, drumstick leaves and amaranth. \\n 4.4.4 Other vegetables and fruits group-4 \\n1. Vegetables - cucumber, capsicum, pumpkin, lady finger, brinjal   \\n2. All gourds like  ash gourd, bottle gourd, snake gourd, bitter gourd, ridge gourd, sponge gourd, etc. come under this \\ncategory. \\n3. All immature beans - french beans, cluster beans, red gram (tender), etc. and peas ,  \\n4. Fruits like melons, grapes, apples, pears, chikkus, bananas and berries. \\nThese vegetables and fruits supplement the minerals, vitamins and fibre provided by group 3 in our diet. The fibrous tissues \\npresent in these fruits and vegetables are not digested and help to move the food -through the digestive tract. Thus they \\nhelp to regulate elimination of waste products from the digestive tract. \\nSize of one serving: We can count as one serving 50 gm portion or half a katori of any vegetable or fruit from this group. It \\nis suggested that we include at least two or more servings from this group daily. Most of the vegeta bles and fruits in this \\ngroup are purchased by weight. Some of the fruits bought by weight are grapes, apples, pears, etc. Bananas and melons are \\nsold by numbers. The edible portion in some of the vegetables, such as capsicum, lady finger, brinja l, french beans, papadi, \\ncluster beans (gawar), beetroot, radish, etc., is a s high as 95 to 98 per cent; while in peas it is only 50 per cent.In bananas \\nthe edible portion varies from 65 to 75 per cent. The same is true of melons. Grapes, apples. pears, chikkus (sapota) and \\nberries are generally eaten with the skin. Thus the edible portion of these fruits is more than 95 per cent. \\n 4.4.5 Sugar, jaggery, oil and fats group-5 \\nFoods in this group add taste and make our food palatable. The morning cup of tea or sherbat we enjo y on a hot summer \\nday have sugar as an essential ingredient. The bread or toast we have at tea time tastes better with butter.The taste of dal, \\nvegetable and salad is enhanced by the seasoning with oil, which is customarily a part of the Indian  diet. So we see the \\nfoods in this group have an important role of impro ving the palatability of our meals. There are basically two major classes \\nof foods included in this group. They are: \\na) Sugar, jaggery and their preparations such as jams, jellies, syrups, squashes etc. and \\n b) Oils, ghee, butter and vanaspati.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='94 \\n \\nAll these foods are mainly a source of energy. Sugars are a readily available source of energy, while oils and  fats are a \\nconcentrated source of energy. We may recall that sugars belong to the carbohydrate family and a gra m of carbohydrate \\nprovides four kilocalories of energy.One gram of fat or oil gives nine kilocalories and that is why it is a concentrated source  \\nof energy. \\nThese will be needed so as to make the food palatable. We can arrive at a good estimate by thinking of how we use it. A cup \\nof tea may require 5-10 gm sugar depending on how sweet we make it. A glass of sherbat may need 15-20 gm sugar.  \\nSize of serving for sugar: So, on an average, 20-25 gm of sugar per day will be enough for a person. It is good to remember \\nthat there is no recommended amount for sugar, as it is not an essential component in nutritional planning. Since we know \\nthat sugar is only a sweetening agent, it is good to take it in reasonably moderate amounts.  \\nOils and fats improve the taste and acceptability of foods to which these are added as a seasoning or dressing. In addition, \\nthese are necessary in the transport and utilisation of fat soluble vitamins in the body. Vegetable oils contain essential fatty \\nacids, which are necessary for growth in the weng and to maintain the health of our skin. It is necessary to include at least \\n15 gm of vegetable oil, such as groundnut, sesame, safflower, cotton seed, maize or soyabean oil in the diet daily. That will \\nmeet the need for essential fatty acids, the remaining amount can be taken as ghee, butter or vanaspati. \\nSize of serving for oils and fats: A teaspoon or 5 gm is a good unit of serving for this group. Since we use a teaspoon to add \\nsugar to beverages and to serve oillfat, it is easy to use it as a measure in serving.The total amou nt of oils and fats in the \\ndiet will vary with our total energy needs and the energy intake from foods of the first two food groups. We may know that \\nhigh fat diets are harmful to our health. Therefore the ICMR Advisory Committee (RDI 1981) suggested that the adult intake \\nof dietary fat be 20 per cent or less of the total calorie intake. \\n4.4.6 Uses of food groups in menu planning \\nPlease note the following important points in the use of the daily food guide in planning a meal: \\n1.  Select foods from the five broad food groups. \\n2. Choose at least the minimum number of servings from each of the food groups. \\n3. Make choices within each group. The foods included in each group are given in detail earlier \\nin this unit. Please remember that foods in each group are similar, but not id entical in food \\nvalue. \\n4. Try to include at least one food from group 2 in each meal. \\n5.  Use vegetables and fruits, which are in season to ensure high quality at reasonable cost. \\nPlease remember, we can add more foods from all groups to the minimum servings suggested, to make the meals \\nsatisfying. As we may have noticed, there are a large number of foods in each group. So we can choos e foods which we like \\nfrom each group and meet our nutritional needs. In a tropical country like India, we have a large va riety of vegetables and \\nfruits available in each season. We can choose any leafy vegetable, for they are all good sources of  the pigment beta -\\ncarotene. We must include sufficient amount of food from each group. The particular food we choose a nd the way we \\nseason it, is a matter of our choice. \\nOne of the questions that may worry we is, will nutritious food be more costly that what we eat at p resent? Or can we \\nafford nutritious food? The answer is an emphatic No for the first question and Yes for the second. Cost is not related to \\nnutritive value of foods. It is dependent on a availability and season; not on its nutrient content. \\nThe foods, which have a great variation in prices, are vegetables and fruits. We know that those, wh ich are in season, cost \\nthe least. What we should know is that at the peak of the season, each vegetable and fruit has the highest nutrient content, \\nflavour and taste. There has been extensive research in this aspect and it has been proved that the nutrient content and \\nyield of any plant food , whether it is spinach, beans, oranges or mangoes, is highest at the peak of the season. When we \\nbuy seasonal foods, we buy the best in terms of quality and nutrients at a reasonable price. Another  point to note is that \\ninexpensive fruits such as amla and  guava are excellent sources of vitamin C, but apples -and grapes, which are costly, are \\npoor sources of this vitamin. \\nWe can meet the needs of different members of our family by using the food guide. For example, the t eenagers in our \\nfamily can take more servings of foods from Group 2 to meet the protein requirements for growth and more servings from \\ngroups 1 and 5 to meet the high energy requirements of body building. One must be cautious about the  affinity to a group'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"95 \\n \\nand should be moderate for food one ta kes from any group. Even if we like it very much, we may not be able to include \\nexact amounts of food from all food groups if we choose a lot more from a single group. \\n4.5 Meal and menu planning \\nAny individual who carries the responsibility of providiilg meals has to take decisions regarding what to serve, how nluch to \\nserve, how much to spend, where to shop, how much to buy, how to prepare food, how to serve meals, a t what hour to \\nserve meal and so on. All such decisions are a part of planning meals. Extending this concept further, one could define meal \\nplanning as a simple practical exercise which irzilolves  applying the knowledge of food, nutrient requirement and individual \\npreferences to plan adequate arzd acceptable nzeals. In other terms, meal planning  means planning for adequate \\nrzutritio~z. Remember meal planning is just not an exercise of selecting the right kind of foods to help meet the  nutrient \\nneeds. It also concerns with preparing/planning attractive and enjoyable meals for all persons. Meal s must taste good and \\nsmell good. Because food is seen before it is tasted, the eyes have a role as well, in food acceptance. Meals must 'look good' \\nto be tasted to be enjoyed. To do this, the planner does not have to be knowledgeable only, but also  imaginativ e and \\ncreative. The art of skillful blending of foods in terms of colour, texture and flavour must be know n. In this context, \\ntherefore, it is said that meal planning is an art. It is an art which develops through thought and inspiration. Meal planning, \\nin fact, is a skill which improves with practice. \\n 4.5.1 Principles and objectives \\n'Menu', as we all know, is nothing but a list of dishes planned for preparation, and forms the very core of all activities in the \\nfood service establishment. Although  it may s eem a simple exercise of providing something to eat and drink, in practice,  \\ngood menu planning requires a lot of skill. It involves planning of balanced meals that  are colourful, appetizing, palatable \\nand within the economic means of the individuals  concerned. When a food has to be bought, prepared and served in large \\nquantities to people of varying tastes and requirements, for example in hospital food service, lot of attention has to be paid \\nfor this activity. It is essential to provide appetizing,  nourishing and attractive meals to the people at a reasonable price. \\nThis is possible only if the meals are planned in advance. \\n1. Planning in advance helps to determine quantities of different foods accurately. Food buying can  be controlled \\nthrough advance buying because the quantities need to be calculated beforehand. Time and effort spent on \\nhaphazard ordering, shopping and receiving of food materials is saved . \\n2. Planning in advance helps to avoid monotony in the menus; variety in terms of colour, flavour and texture and \\ndifferent methods of cooking could be given due consideration if the menu is planned in time. If the  meal fit the \\nbudget, it cannot be put into practice. Bulk purchasing, including seasonal foods help in this; this  means that menu \\nplanning has to be done in advance.  \\n3. The dietitian is responsible for giving clear instructions to the kitchen staff to ensure harmony am ong the staff \\ninvolved in preparation. This is possible only if the menus are planned in advance.  \\n4. In hospitals, the quantity of nutrients for the day for patients with various diseases and  its distribution between the \\nvarious meals of the day all need due consideration so that the patients are satisfied with the serv ice provided. This \\nis possible only with planning menus. Having u nderstood the rationale for menu planning, we will learn the factors \\nthat affect the food choice. \\n 4.5.2 Factors affecting food choice \\nVarious factors influence our food choices. They are: \\n1. Nutritional Factors \\nFood choices made based on sound principles of nutrition will be conducive to good health while carelessness about \\nnutrition can contribute towards chronic degenerative diseases like diabetes and heart diseases. We do not consume \\nnutrients as such, but as meals/dishes made up of foodstuffs containing t he nutrients in various amounts, knowledge of \\nfood groups will help one to formulate a healthy diet. The various foods in a food group are similar  in a general chemical \\n(nutrient) composition, and hence contribute almost similar types of nutrients to the d iet, although not always in the same \\nproportion.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='96 \\n \\n At this point, it is worthwhile to learn about the evolution of the concept of Food groups. In the 1940s, nutritionists began \\ntranslating RDA into terms that are more practical so that people with no speci al training in nutrition could still estimate \\nwhether their nutritional needs were being met. \\n A seven-food-group plan was one of the early formats. Daily food choices had to include food from each food group . This \\nplan was simplified into five food - groups. By the mid -1950s, a four -food-group plan was established that included milk \\ngroup, meat group, fruit-vegetable group and bread and cereal group. In 1979, the names of the groups were revised, and a \\nfifth group containing fats, sweets and alcoholic bever ages was added. We need to be cautious while  consuming this last \\ngroup, though it can supply essential fatty acids and vitamin E. \\nThe following discussion briefly summarizes the nutritive value of each of these food groups. Let us begin with cereals. \\n1)   Cereals and Bread Group \\nCereals form the staple of the Indian diet. These grains are the main source of energy in the Indian  diets contributing as  \\nthey do 60 -70% of daily energy intake of majority of Indians. This is because  they are rich sources of carbohydrates. \\nProteins in cereal grains are partially complete as grains are low in one or two essential amino acids - lysine and threonine. \\nHowever, cereals when eaten with pulses, as is the common practice in India, the protein quality imp roves due to m utual \\nsupplementation between the cereal and pulse proteins, the former being deficient while the latter ( pulse) being rich in \\nlysine. Cereals are low in fat, but contain 1-3% omega-3 fatty acids. \\nCereals in general, cannot be considered rich sources of mi nerals. However, ragi is rich in calcium (i.e. 344 mg1100 gm); \\nbajra, and whole-wheat flour are high in iron content. The non-nutrient factors such as phytates, oxalates and fibers, which \\nare present in them, interfere with the absorption of calcium and iron. Cereals, particularly the whole grains, are important \\nsources of B-vitamins. Since most of these vitamins reside in the outermost layer of the grains, they are lost during polishing \\nand refining. Parboiling, which involves soaking in water and subseque nt steaming of paddy, results in seeping of vitamins \\npresent in outer layer into the grain; thus, parboiled milled rice retains much of the vitamins. Cer eals are neither rich in \\nvitamin A nor C; they do not contain any vitamin B12 either; however, whole grain cereals are rich in the other B-vitamins. \\n2) Pulse/Meat, Poultry/Sea Food Group \\nThey are excellent sources of protein, containing 25% protein, but varying from each other in other respects. Let us discuss \\neach of these groups and find out what these differences are: \\n1. Pulse group \\nPulses are rich sources of proteins (20-25 g1100 g), the limiting amino acid being methionine. However, protein quality \\ncan be improved by mutual  supplementation with cereals. Soybean though has exceptionally high protein content  (43 \\ng/100 g). Pulses have carbohydrates in fair amounts.  Pulses are rich in iron, with soybean, cowpea, black gram and \\nhorse gram being exceptionally rich. \\nSprouting or germination of legumes, a practice common in indian households, brings about beneficial  effects. Vitamin \\nC, which is practically absent in dry pulses, increases in significant amounts upon sprouting; folic  acid also increases \\nthreefold. Interestingly sprouting brings about a decrease in flatus -forming compounds originally present in non -\\ngerminated pulses. Sprouted pulses require a much shorter time to get cooked. The anti nutritional factors  such as \\ntrypsin inhibitors, are inactivated by sprouting, thus rendering them more easily digestible. \\n2. Fish and Seafood group \\nThey are rich sources of proteins (20-25%) of a high biological value. Dry fishes contain more (60%) proteins since most \\nof the moisture is lost. Dried fishes have exceptionally high amounts of calcium since it is consume d with the bones. \\nSome varieties of fish such as hilsa, seer, katla, pomfret and mackerel are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are known \\nto protect against cardiovascular diseases. \\n3. Meat and Poultry group \\nMeat and poultry are rich sources of proteins of high biological value.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"97 \\n \\nThey do not contain carbohydrates. \\nAll the meats except egg yolk contain haem iron; therefore, the iron is well absorbed. However, egg yolk con tains non-\\nhaem iron; the phosvitin, which is present in egg yolks, interferes with iron absorption but consumi ng vitamin C in the \\nsame meal helps lo overcome this problem. \\n1. Egg yolk is rich in vitamin A and p-carotene, while liver is rich in vitamin A. \\n2. Red meats are rich in saturated fats, while fish and poultry contain very small amounts of fats. Lea n meats \\ncontain less fat. \\n3. Organ meats such as liver, kidney and brain and egg yolks are rich in cholesterol. Including large amounts of \\nsuch foods in the diet, especially along with saturated fats in the diet has been shown to result in  high serum \\ncholesterol, which is a risk factor for coronary heart diseases. \\n4. Flesh foods are rich in iron, zinc and vitamin B12, but are devoid of fibre and vitamin C. \\n1. Dairy/Milk group \\nThis first food of mammals is rich in body-building proteins and bone-forming calcium, besides being the only source of \\nvitamin BIZ for the vegetarians. However, milk does not contain vitamin C, besides being deficient in iron. Dairy milk of \\nvarying fat contents is available in the market, the highest fat milk is known as full fat milk, the next known as standard \\nmilk and the lowest is skim milk. Low fat  dairy milk is better suited for adults, especially the ones who want to watch \\ntheir weights and have a check on their cholesterol levels. Curds are an ideal substitute for people  who have problems \\nin digesting milk due to the deficiency of the enzyme lactase. \\n2. Vegetable-Fruit Group \\nVegetables and fruits add colour and variety to our diets in addition to providing a host of essential nutrients and phyto \\nnutrients that help to prevent chronic degenerative diseases. Fruits are also high in potassium and help to establish a \\nproper balance between the sodium and potassium content of our diets. \\nAn often -neglected group, this group provides for the water -soluble vitamins and minerals, so vital for the proper \\nfunctioning of the body's various mechanisms. These deli cious natural capsules of vitamins and minerals offer \\nprotection against many diseases, especially, heart diseases and certain types of cancer. Most important is the fact that \\nit offers a variety in terms of texture, colour and flavour and thus helps to avoid monotony in the meal.  \\nGreen leafy vegetables are rich sources of various nutrients such as iron, calcium, p -carotene, folic acid and vitamin C. \\nTheir contribution to energy intake is very low, usually less than 2-3%. Yellow-orange coloured vegetables are rich in b-\\ncarotene they must therefore be included at least four to five times in our diets. The citrus fruits  such as oranges, \\nsweet-lime (mosasmbi) and also, papaya and guavas are rich in vitamin C and the yellow -orange ones such as mango \\nand papaya are rich in p -carotene. Fruits with high water content such as melons have low energy content, while dry \\nfruits such as dates and raisins are high in energy. \\n3. Fats, Oils and Sugar Group \\nThis group imparts flavour to the items and thereby improves the palatability. Items incorporating them have a “melt in \\nthe mouth” feeling. The fats and oils are generally the most expensive among the dietary items and t herefore intakes \\nare determined by the economic affordability. A deficit in the intake of fats and oils is rare in the affluent population \\nwhile an apparent surfeit in this group is often responsible for obesity, heart ailments and certain  types of cancers. \\nHence, one needs to use caution in the amounts used.  \\nEach of these groups provides some but not all of t he nutrients. No single natural food supplies all the essential \\nnutrients and the phytonutrients in proper proportions to maintain health, nor is a food group more important than \\nthe other does. A meal plan that includes adequate amounts of foods from the different groups provides the \\nfoundation for good health that needs to be supported by food hygiene, clean drinking water and a clean environment. \\nBesides nutritional factors there are some other factors too which affect food choices.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"98 \\n \\n4. Other Factors \\nAlthough people are aware and realize that their food choices affect their health, they often choose food f or \\nother reasons. Let us review these factors. \\n1. Personal Preferences: Often people choose foods because they Iike certain flavours. While we Indians enjoy \\nstrong curry spices, the Western cuisine does not include them. Similarly, asafoetida (hing) features in the \\nSouth Indian preparations while garam masala features in the North Indian cuisine. \\n2. Habit: We often select food just out of habit. While idli and dosa feature in South Indian breakfast, parathas \\nfeature more commonly in the North Indian cuisine. \\n3. Social Interaction : Food signifies friendliness. Meals are social events, and the sharing of food is a part of \\nhospitality, Social customs almost compel people to accept food or drink offered by a host or shared  by a \\ngroup.  \\n4. Availability, Convenience and Economy: People eat foods that are accessible, quick and easy to prepare, and \\nwithin their financial means. Many people frequently eat out or have food delivered, which limits food choices \\nto the selections on the restaurant's menu. Seasonal availability of food is particularly important aspect, which \\ninfluences the food choices, particularly for lower income group families. \\n5. Positive and Negative Associations : People tend to associate foods with occasions like sweets during \\ncelebrations and happy occasions (birthdays and festiv als) whereas we often develop a dislike to foods that \\nwe have to eat when we are sick or when forced to eat when not hungry. \\n6. Emotional Comfort:  Some people eat in response to an emotional stimulus for e.g. to relieve boredom or \\ndepression or to calm anxiet y. A lonely person may choose to eat rather than to invite a friend and risk \\nrejection. Eating in response to emotions can easily lead to over-eating and obesity.  \\n7. Body Image: Sometimes, people select foods which they believe will improve their physical appearance and \\navoid those that may be detrimental. Such decisions can be beneficial when based on sound nutrition and \\nfitness knowledge but undermine good health when based on food fads or are carried to extremes. \\n4.5.3 Exchange list vs. food composition table \\nA dietitian is expected to make quick and reasonably accurate estimation of the nutritive value of die ts or calculate diets \\nthat must be controlled for one or more nutrients. The nutritive value can be calculated from the Fo od Composition Tables \\n(given in the Nutritive Value of Indian Foods by Gopalan et. al., NIN, Hyderabad). Initially, dietitians and physicians were \\naware that Food Composition Tables used for calculating therapeutic diets were cumbersome, time -consuming and \\nneedlessly precise and dietitians did not have the time to calculate for each day the energy and nutrient composition of the \\nfood required to fulfill the dietary prescription. Thus, an Exchange List was evolved. The exchange list is a grouping of foods \\nin which specified amounts o f all the foods provide approximately  equal amount of (the same amount) carbohydrate, \\nprotein and fat and hence,  energy content. Specific foods within the group may vary slightly in nutritive value from the \\naverages stated in the group. These differences i n composition tend to cancel out because of the variety of foods selected \\nfrom day to day. Thus, any food within a given list can be substituted or exchanged for any other fo od in that list in the \\ngiven quantities.  \\nFood exchange system allows one to choos e a variety of foods with adequate nutrients. The food exchange system is \\nimportant in planning a nutritious diet. Essentially, the Food Exchange System allows variety in the diets without altering \\nthe energy or the macronutrient contents. The exchange lis ts are especially useful in planning diets for metabolic diseases \\nand are very useful in the management of obesity.  \\n1.   Steps in the Development of Exchange List \\nAs mentioned above, when we group together similar food items so that each supplies a consta nt amount of a particular \\nnutrient, we call the group a food exchange. Given herewith are the steps which when followed, will guide we in developing \\nthe exchange list. It is a difficult task to develop an exchange list for Indian foods as our dishes  defy a ny attempt at \\nstandardization. But anyways we can try. \\n1. The first step in developing an exchange list is the standardization of serving or portion sizes. The portion sizes \\nvary considerably in India. ldlis, dosas, chapattis and puris of different sizes in different states and in different \\nhouseholds. Despite this, portion sizes have been defined.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"99 \\n \\n2. The second step is to calculate the energy, carbohydrate, protein and fat content of one serving or portion size \\nof the different dishes. T his can be done by converting the cooked weight of one serving of a dish into raw \\nweight of the ingredients that have gone into it. Although allowances should be made for cooking losses, this \\nhas not been done. Future exchange lists may take care of this. From the raw weights of the ingredients in one \\nserving and using the Indian Food Composition tables, the energy, carbohydrate, protein and fat cont ent of \\none serving can be calculated. \\n3. The third step is to create an exchange list of different dishes in ter ms of standard portion sizes that would \\nprovide approximately the same energy or carbohydrate or fat. Since foods contain widely varying amo unt of \\nthe macronutrients, serving or portion sizes are defined for a group of more or less homogeneous foo ds. For \\nexample, all cereals provide approximately the same number of calories, approximately 350 per 100 g r aw \\nweight and about the same amount of carbohydrates, about 70 g per 100 g raw  weight Therefore, cereal \\nexchanges are grouped together. Similarly, there ar e vegetable, fruits, and milk and meat exchanges. Within \\neach of these food groups, the composition of the different items in terms of carbohydrate, protein and fats \\nremain similar. \\n4. An example is provided in Table 12.2 from a comprehensive exchange list developed by the Lady Irwin College. \\nAnother list, originally developed by the Dietary Department of CMC, Vellore and subsequently added to by \\nmany other institutions; consists of six exchange groups. These are cereals, pulses, milk, meat, fru its and \\nvegetables A and B. A brief review of these exchanges follows: \\n1. Cereal exchange per serving, provides 85 kcal, 20 g carbohydrate and 1.6 g protein \\n2. Milk exchange provides per serving 65 kcal, 4 g carbohydrate, 3 g protein and 4 g fat. \\n3. Meat exchange provides per serving 85 Kcal and varying amounts of CHO, protein and fat. \\n4. Fruit exchanges provide per serving 40 Kcal and 10 g carbohydrate. \\n5. The vegetable A group exchange provides 30 Kcal while the B group provides 30-50 Kcal. \\nUsing the steps elaborated above, we hope  we will be in a position to use the exchange system to calculate a diet pattern, \\nwhich calculates the diet order in kinds and number of servings of food exchanges to be consumed by any individual or a \\npatient each day. Although the exchange system reflect s average and not specific energy and nutrient values, the \\ntherapeutic success that results when the values are used to calculate the diet pattern demonstrate that the method is \\naccurate enough to serve this purpose. An adequate diet, providing all nutrients is needed throughout our lives.  \\nAn adequate and balanced diet is one that meets all the nutrient needs of an individual for maintenance , repair, growth \\nand development. A balanced diet provides all the nutrients in required amounts and proper proportio ns. It can be \\nachieved through maintaining variety in foods and including foods from the different food groups dis cussed above. The \\nquantity of food needed to meet the nutrient requirements vary with age, gender, physical activity etc. \\nRefer to table no.4.5.3a for nutritive values used in dev. of exchange list of cereals. \\nRefer to table no.4.5.3b for food exchanges. \\n4.5.4  Planning a menu \\nGenerally menu planning is done for adults. The term 'adult' refers to any individual in the age group of twenty years a nd \\nabove. The period beginning from twenty years and extending through old  age until the time of death is considered the \\nperiod of adulthood. Adulthood represents the stage in life when an individual has completed higher growth in terms of  \\nbody size. The nutritional need is for maintenance of body functions rather than for growth. \\nAs an individual ages, there is a gradual and progressive change in body functioning. This is becaus e there is an increased \\nbreakdown of tissues while the renewal process is slow . These changes associated with ageing are common to all \\nindividuals, but there is a variation from person to person. In some individuals, the changes become  significant relatively \\nearly, whereas, in other cases these changes appear much later in adulthood. All these factors influence the nutrient needs \\nof adults.  \\n1.  Recommended  Dietary Allowances (RDA) \\nWe already know that recommended dietary allowances, are estimates of nutrients to be consumed daily to ensure the \\nrequirements of all individuals are met in a given population. Growth is no longer an energy-demanding factor in adulthood \\nand BMR is relatively constant among population groups of a given age and gender. Rather habitual ph ysical activity and\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"100 \\n \\nbody weight are the main determinants for the diversit y in energy requirements, in particular for adult populations with \\ndifferent lifestyles. Table no.4.5.4a presents the ICMR recommended dietary intakes of adults. \\nThe nutrient requirements for adults are given under the three categories based on activity level - sedentary, moderate and \\nheavy work, and \\n1. The nutrient requirements for men and women are given separately. For computing RDA, the ICMR has ta ken \\nbody weight of 'reference man' as 60 kg and that of 'woman' as 50 kg. \\n2. The requirements for proteins are based on body weight. The requirements are expressed as 1g protein per kg \\nbody weight. \\n3. RDIs for thiamin, riboflavin and niacin are dependent on RDAs for energy. \\n \\nRefer to table no.4.5.4a for RDIs for adult man (60-65 kg) \\nRefer to table no.4.5.4a for RDIs for adult man (60-65 kg) \\n \\n4. Some menus and dietary guidelines: \\n \\nNow that we have a thorough and complete understanding about food exchange lists and the nutrient re quirements for \\nadults, we shall review a few regional menus and critically analyze them from nu tritional point of view. But first, we would \\nlike we to study the dietary guidelines for Indians developed by National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), ICMR. These guidelines \\npresented in Tables 12.5, 12.6 and Table 12,7 provide information as to the number o f portions and actual diets that need \\nto be consumed in order to ensure optimal health for Indian adult man and women. These diets, we wou ld notice, are \\nbased on locally available foods within the reach of the people and generally are in conformity with  ou r tradition and \\ncustom. Using these guidelines, we can plan diets for adults. \\nMENU (SOUTH INDIAN) \\nMenu  \\nBreakfast \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\nMid morning  \\n \\n \\nLunch \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSnacks \\n \\nDinner \\n \\nRagi Kanji \\nRagi \\nMilk \\nSugar \\n \\nRice flakes (roasted and sweetened) \\nGuava \\n \\nRice \\nRoti \\nDal \\nAloo Palak, (Palak, Potato and Tomato) \\nDry fish chutney \\n \\n \\nLemon rice (with groundnuts) \\n \\nPongal Rice \\nMung dal \\nDrumstick leaves Bhaji \\n \\nNutritional analysis: \\n1. Ragi Kanji is given forms a good source of calcium in diet. \\n2. Rice flakes forms one of fairly good sources of iron and to aid for good absorption of iron, Guava is given, \\nwhich is one of the cheapest sources of vitamin C. \\n3. Lunch has normal staple diet like rice, dal and roti which is accompanied by a 100g palak - one of the sources \\nof green leafy vegetable in diet and dry fish chutney, which forms a good source of protein.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='101 \\n \\n4. Lemon rice is given, which is typical to South Indian inenu and forms one of the sources of vitamin C. Lemon \\nshould be squeezed just before consumption to avoid oxidation of vitamin C. It also contains peanuts, which \\nadds protein and calories to the diet. \\n5. Pongal forms a good supplementation of protein through vegetarian sources due to mutual supplementat ion \\nof rice and pulse, which completes the inadequacies of each other. \\n6. Dinner also contains d rumstick leaves chutney, which forms one of sources of calcium. Curds form good \\nsource of protein. \\nMENU (NORTH INDIAN) \\nThis north Indian menu is planned for a pregnant lady, who is anemic, doing household chores and bel ongs to a low socio -\\neconomic groups, So let us proceed and find out what nutrients considered and which food items have been selected to \\nfulfill the above listed criteria. \\n            MENU (NORTH INDIAN) \\nMenu Items \\nBreakfast \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLunch \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSnacks \\n \\n \\nDinner \\n \\nMoong sprouts \\nPotato Parantha - Groundnuts, wheat four, fat \\nTea - Milk, sugar \\nFruit – Sugar \\n \\nBajra Roti (Bajra flour, fat) \\nDal (Masoor dal,, onion, tomato, fat) \\nDiy fish chutney \\nVegetables (Yam, onion, tomato, french beans, fat) \\nPlain curds \\n \\nTea - Milk, sugar \\nMasala roti (Wheat flour, groundnuts) \\n \\nPlain rice \\nDal (masoor dal, tomato, fat) \\nVegetable (amaranth, potato, onion, tomato, fat) \\nButter milk \\n \\n \\nNutritional analysis: \\nThe plan is for a anaemic pregnant lady, from a lower socio -economic level and doing moderate level of work, hence \\nselection of foods is made accordingly. \\n-  Among cereals, along with rice, whole -wheat flour, some amount of Bajra is also incorporated to fulfill the iron \\nrequirements. \\n-  Among pulses, as already to her low economic level, rationale for pulses is a big r estrictive. Hence, it has been made \\na point to incorporate sprouts to provide for some additional vitamins and minerals. \\n-  There is also an accommodation made for nuts (groundnuts, being cheap) to meet her energy requiremen ts along \\nwith calcium, iron, and protein. \\n-  Milk is very important for her condition as milk is a very good source of calcium which is required in highest \\nquantities. \\n-  In flesh, dry fish has been incorporated, which is a cheaper than other fish foods and at the same t ime, the best \\nsource of iron and calcium, which are the basic requirements of a pregnant woman.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='102 \\n \\n- There is a need to give good amount of fruits and vegetables in the diet (increased need for vitamin s, minerals, \\nantioxidants, fibre).

A daily food guide has been developed for use in India, taking into account foods available and norm ally used \\nin the Indian diet; the normal meal pattern of Indians and the nutritional needs as indicated by the  \\nRecommended Dietary Intakes (RDI). We learnt about the foods included in each group, the size of serving of \\neach and the minimum number of servings from each group needed to meet the nutritional needs of an \\nindividual. We can use the guide to meet the needs of an individual whose need is hi gher due to strenuous \\nactivities. We have learnt to use the food guide as a tool in planning adequate diets and to evaluat e diets for \\nnutritional adequacy. \\n3. We learnt about the meaning of the term 'menu' and the concept of menu planning. We saw the various \\nbenefits of menu planning and the nutritional and non -nutritional factors affecting people’s food choices. \\nFurther, to facilitate the process of menu planning, we learnt about food exchange  lists and food composition \\ntables. We also learnt the steps involved in the development of food exchange list and planned a few low cost \\nmenus along with their nutritional  analysis, where we saw how meals must be planned based on the \\nimportant nutrients, physical activity, and gender and income level. In addition, we got to have a look at a few \\nsample menu plans along with their nutritional justification.\"),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"112 \\n \\n5.2 Infancy  \\nInfancy is a period of rapid growth. From the safe protected world in the mother's womb, where it was nourished, the baby \\nnow comes into an environment that places a lot of stress on it. The baby has to make an effort to get the food it needs and \\nhas to cope up with the infections. Breast -feeding is unique because it nourishes the baby and protects it from many \\ninfectious diseases. As the baby grows, mother's milk alone is not sufficient and it will need other baby foods. \\n5.2.1 Growth and development \\nDuring the first year of life, the infant grows and develops far more rapidly than at any ot her stage in life. A number of \\nimportant changes accompany this stage.  \\n\\uf0b7 Physiological Changes \\nThese changes bear important relationship to the care and development of infants. They are: \\n1. Changes in physical development \\n2. Changes in mental development \\n3. Changes in gastrointestinal system \\n4. Development of excretory system \\n5. Changes in body composition \\n6. Changes in feeding behavior \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Growth Monitoring \\nGrowth monitoring is a tool that helps to identify growth [altering at an early stage and helps to institute  corrective \\nmeasures so that malnutrition can he avoided. In growth monitoring, weight is plotted against age accurately on the growth \\nchart. Growth charts are available with all pediatricians, health workers, anganwadi worker and heal th centers. The growth \\nchart depicts vaccination schedule, birth history, general guidelines, disease history and one -year weight record with \\nguidelines of infant feeding. Interpretation of growth charts is very important for any health and nutrition professional. The \\nupward curve indicates weight gain while flat curve indicates no weight gain. The downward curve indicates weight loss and \\nis not desirable. \\nBesides identifying growth faltering, growth charts also provide the following information:  \\n1. The growth is consider ed normal or satisfactory if the curve falls above the topmost line indicating - 80% of the \\nideal weight for age.  \\n2. The growth curve falling between lines indicating 1 and 2 shows that body weight is 71 to 80% of the  ideal, This \\nindicates 1st  degree malnutrition. \\n3. The curve falling between second and third line shows 61 -70% of the ideal body weight. This indicates 2 nd degree \\nmalnutrition. \\n4. The curve falling between third and fourth line shows 50-60% of the ideal body weight. This indicates 3 rd degree \\nmalnutrition. \\n5. The curve falling below fourth line  shows body weight to be below 50% of the ideal indicates 4 th degree \\nmalnutrition. \\n \\nRefer to table no. 5.2.1 for the growth chart of infants \\nThe weight and height is compared with those of well -to-do Indian children as given in Table 5.2.1. It takes 1-3 years for an \\ninfant to establish his own genetic growth pattern. When this figure is established (such as height -for-age or weight -for-\\nage), the child's measurements should then  move along the curve. The first three y ears are crucial, as malnutrition is most \\ncommon and severe during this stage. Height-for-age is a measure of achieved linear growth that can be used as an index of \\npast nutritional status. \\n\\uf0b7 Health Monitoring \\nInfections are a major cause of malnutrition in children. For many of the preventable early childhood diseases, vaccines are \\nnow available so that these diseases of early childhood can be prevented providing a better opportunity for normal growth. \\nAlso known as childhood immunizations  schedule these schedules must be adhered to strictly. Malnutrition, high infection \\nrate, incomplete immunization and poor diarrhea management are major cause of high infant mortality rate (IMR) and \\nunder five mortality rates. Use of ORS and ensuring complete immunization schedule has been able to reduce mortality rate \\nconsiderably.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"113 \\n \\n5.2.2 Nutrient needs and RDA \\nThe nutritional requirements of infants are met by exclusive breast -feeding until 6 months, after which it is imperative to \\nintroduce complementary feeding.  \\n\\uf0b7 Energy:  \\nEnergy requirements of infants are based on the energy intake through breast milk by infants of well-nourished mothers. \\nThe energy demand for growth constitutes up to 35% of Total energy expenditure (TEE) at 0 -3 months and 17.5% at 3 -6 \\nmonths. The growth requirement should be added to TEE to give total energy requirement.  \\nRefer to table 5.2.2a for energy requirements of infants \\n\\uf0b7 Protein:  \\nProtein allowances of infants should meet both growth and maintenance requirements. Protein allowanc es are computed \\nfrom the protein content of breast milk  and the volume of milk consumed by healthy infants growing normally. In case of \\ninfants beyond six months, breast milk alone cannot satisfy protein needs. Supplementary food has to be introduced, \\nconsisting of a source of good quality protein like milk and milk products, cereal and pulse combina tions, non-vegetarian \\nfoods like fish, chick en etc. Hence, protein allowances for infants between 6 -12 months are in  terms of both milk protein \\nand vegetable protein, each contributing almost equally to the total protein intake. \\nRefer to table 5.2.2 b for protein requirements of infants. \\n\\uf0b7 Fats: Adequately breast-fed infants receive nearly 30 g fat per day, of which 10% is linoleic acid and 1% is linolenic \\nacid. Breast milk thus suffices the needs of EFA for infants, which is about 6 -en%, Human breast milk is superior to \\nother milk for its long chain n-6 and n-3 PUFA content that are biologically more potent. \\n\\uf0b7 Calcium: The calcium requirements of young infants are computed from the calcium content of breast milk and  \\nvolume of breast milk intake. Up to 6 months of life, 300 mg calcium intake is adequate. ICMR (1990) recommends \\n500 mg of calcium daily during the entire period of infancy. \\n\\uf0b7 Phosphorus: Phosphorus requirements are linked to the calcium intake and the requirements of both these minerals \\nis .almost equal. However, in all age groups, Ca: P ratio should be 1:1 except infancy when 1:1.5 is recommended. \\n\\uf0b7 Iron: In first two weeks of life, the hemoglobin falls to a normal level of 11 -12 g/d as against 17-23 g/dl at birth. The \\niron is redistributed in the first month of infancy hence breast milk alone mee ts iron needs of infants. Although iron \\nin breast milk is low, it is very well absorbed. Iron fortified complementary foods are important in  maintaining the \\niron status of infants especially in situations where additional iron rich foods are not offered to  the infant after 6 \\nmonths of age.  \\n\\uf0b7 Vitamins: The requirements of both classes of vitamins - fat-soluble and water soluble are given in table 5.2.2.c. \\n\\uf0b7 Trace elements : Most elements, such as zinc and iodine, hold a major significance in infant nutrition. Zinc is \\nassociated with growth while iodine with the brain growth and development. Their significance starts  since \\nconception in the mother and should be adequately provided. \\nRefer to table no. 5.2.2 c for RDAs of various nutrients for infants \\nCompared to adults an infant’s requirements are considerably very high. The RDA table shows the energy requirement of a \\nsedentary man to be 2400 kcal. If we express energy in terms of per kg of body weight, we find that the energy \\nrequirements of an infant (per kg of body weight) are much higher. The need for other nutrients like proteins, vitamins and \\nminerals (per kg of body weight) is also several times more in infants than adults. \\nRefer to table 5.2.2.d for comparison of nutrient needs of an infant & adult \\n5.2.3 Diet and feeding patterns \\nDiet and feeding patterns of infants has been sub -divided into 0-6 months and 6-12 months. Breast milk is best food for an \\ninfant. It is nature's provision to satisfy the needs of the infant for growth and development inclu ding emot ional \\ndevelopment. Even a poorest mother is able to nurse her child satisfactorily at least during the fir st few months. WHO \\nrecommends a normal mother to exclusively breast feed until 6 months of age. \\n\\uf0b7 0 to 6 months: The term exclusive breast-feeding is used when all fluids, energy and nutrients are provided by breast \\nmilk, with the possible exception of small amount of medicinal supplements. Exclusive breast -feeding means that not even \\nwater is given. Breast milk provides enough water even for the hot summer months.  \\nSometimes exclusive breast -feeding cannot be sustained. Working mothers join their duty in the fourth month and \\nexclusively breast -feeding stops. Although infant needs of almost all nutrients are met from breast milk alone but in \\nabsence of bre ast milk, other milk can be given. Giving undiluted homogenized, pasteurized, toned milk that has be en \\nboiled at home is a relatively inexpensive option. Buffalo's milk can be given by initially diluting  in the ratio of 2: l.

The usual challenge in alternate milk is \\nwater quality, hygiene, handling, and milk allergies. Cow milk is known to cause allergies worldwide . Heat -treated milk \\nformulae have shown better tolerance but are expensive and their over-dilution is a major cause of malnutrition. \\nRefer to table 5.2.3a  Nutrient composition of different milks/100 g \\n\\uf0b7 6 to 12 months: As the infant grows older, mother's milk alone is not sufficient to meet his increasing needs. This  is \\nseen in some infants between 4 -6 months by the downward slope in the growth curve. Especially if for some reason, \\nmother's milk is insufficient, the infant is then weaned. Weaning is a process of gradually introducing foods other than \\nbreast milk. Weaning foods are those foods, which are used during the gradual transition of the infant from breas t-feeding \\nto a normal diet. It may start with the introduction of other milk but the best option is to continu e breast milk and give \\nother solid foods in li quid and semi solid consistency. The introduction of complementary foods/weaning foods ensures \\nfulfillment of nutritional requirements and gradually introduces the child to family eating pattern.  By the time the child is  \\none year old, he should get used to eating the normal family diet. \\nBalanced Diet for Infants \\nThe infants aged 6-12 months can eat in a day's diet: \\n\\uf0b7 30-45 of cereal,  \\n\\uf0b7 15 g pulse, \\n\\uf0b7 200-500 ml of animal milk (if breast-fed then 200 ml top milk is recommended), \\n\\uf0b7 50 g roots and tubers, \\n\\uf0b7 25 g green leafy vegetables,  \\n\\uf0b7 25 g other vegetables,  \\n\\uf0b7 100 g fruit,  \\n\\uf0b7 25 g sugar,  \\n\\uf0b7 10 g fat.  \\nAdding extra fat in daI khichri is a recommended practice to ensure 40 en % of fat for infant's growth and decreasing bulk in \\ndiet. \\nRefer to table no. 5.2.3.b for complementary foods for 4 to 12 months infants. \\nFeeding Schedule in Infancy  \\n1) Milk feeding 5 - 6 times/day.  \\nContinue breast-feeding.  \\nExclusive breast-feeding up to 6 months even during illness.  \\nFollow demand feeding. \\n2) 6 months: Start complementary feeding;  \\nFeed 3-4 times/day, example, porridge: twice/day,  \\nVegetable – once/day,  \\nFruit – once/day.  \\n3)       6-9 months: Continue breast-feeding, \\n  Feed 4-5times/day e.g. family diet – twice/day,  \\nCommercial premixes or homemade multi grain mixes including amylase rich foods (ARF) – twice/day,  \\nVegetable/fruits - once a day. \\n4) 9-12 months: Continue breast-feeding, feed family food;  \\nFeed 5-6 times/day  \\nFamily food twice/day, \\nInstant mix – twice/day,  \\nFruits/vegetables - once a day. \\nSource: WCD. Govt. of India. \\n5.3 Childhood \\nAlso known as school age, the school age period can be termed as 'Middle Childhood'. School age children are those who \\nare between 6 and 12 years. After 13 years, children enter their adolescent years. You may call them teenagers. The school \\nage is a serene or calm period because the child has fewer problems than the preschool period or -during adolescence.  The \\nphysical ability of the child improves and makes  the child more skilful. Thus, the child may take more active part in sports.\"),\n",

One imp ortant thing in the \\nchild's life is the daily routine of school and many extracurricular activities \\n5.3.1 Growth and development \\nChildren between 6 years and the onset of the adolescence grow relatively slowly. One characteristic  that we notice is that \\nthere is individuality in growth rate of children in these years. There is little growth in head size, but the trunk and legs grow \\n(remember brain growth is completed during the preschool years.) Skeletal maturation occurs during these years. Annually \\nthe increment in height may be approximately 5 to 6cm, with girls gaining a little more than boys do . Weight increases are \\nusually between two and three kilograms per year. \\n5.3.2 Nutrient needs and RDA \\nChildren in this age group have no special nutritional needs. Since children are growing at this age, they require all the \\nnutrients and hence a well-balanced diet. Children who play a lot, and are very active, will need more energy than children \\nof the same age who are less active i.e., one who spends a lot of time in reading, or watching telev ision or painting or \\ndrawing. If the child is getting an adequate diet , he/she will have a low risk of having nutritional problems. However, any \\ninadequacy in a child's diet will affect him/her more q uickly and more severely than it would affect an adult. Blood \\nformation keeps pace with the need for increased blood supply fo r the child's growing body. Children from this age group \\nhave more resistance to disease than the preschoolers. Another important point to bear in mind is that girls should have an \\nadequate iron intake so that they have sufficient iron stores before they reach menarche. Under nutrition may have serious \\nconsequences. If the child is undernourished, he/she will become easily tired and will not be able to perform well in school \\nor be able to do the physical activities well or fully. Such a child may be susceptible to infection as well. \\nRefer to table no. 5.3.2 for RDAs of various nutrients for schoolchildren \\nICMR (1990) gives requirements of 4-6 years and 7-9 years categories. After 10 years of age, boys’ and girls’ are categorized \\ninto three categories i.e. 10-12 years, 13-15 years and 16-18 years. Boys, as compared to girls, have higher lean body mass \\n(LBM), skeletal mass and lower fat as a ratio of total body mass. This difference in body compositio n leads to differences in \\ntheir nutrient needs as LBM has more metabolic activity than adipose tissue.  \\n\\uf0b7 Energy: Occupational and recreational activities variably affect energy requirements. The energy requirements are \\ncalculated for children over five years of age and for  adolescents with lifestyles involving three levels of habitual physical \\nactivity. They are: \\n1. Light physical lifestyles: Children and adolescents who spend several hours at school or in sedentary occu pations; do \\nnot practice physical sports regularly; generally use motor vehicles for transportat ion; and spend most leisure time in \\nactivities that require little physical effort, such as watching television, reading, using computer s or playing without \\nmuch body displacement. \\n2. Vigorous lifestyles : Children and adolescents who walk long distances or u se bicycles for transportation; engage in \\nhigh energy-demanding occupations, or perform high energy -demanding chores for several hours each day; and/or \\npractise sports or exercise that demand a high level of physical effort for several hours, several days of the week. \\n3. Moderate lifestyles: Children and adolescents with habitual physical activity that is more strenuous than the activities \\nfor a light lifestyle, but not as demanding as the activities for vigorous lifestyle have a moderate lifestyle. \\n \\nAs the lifestyles suggest, the intake of calories shall depend accordingly. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Protein: FAO/WHO/UIW (1985) recommends factorial method to compute their protein requirements. The factorial \\nvalue is increased by 50% to obtain the physiological requirements for growth and further 25% has been added to give \\nsafe level of intake. \\n\\uf0b7 Fats: The linoleic acid requirements for schoolchildren and adolescents have been set at 3-en%. In terms of visible \\nfats, ICMR (1990) has recommended an intake of 5-en%. Since their energy requirements are almost equal to adults, \\nthe minimum amount of visible fat works out to be 12 g/d. \\n\\uf0b7 Calcium Calcium requirements in children and adolescents can be calculated based on calcium accretion during  \\ngrowth. In absence of definite data on Indian children and the rate of absorption, ICMR recommended 400 mg for the \\nage group1-9 yrs. Good physical activity, adequate calcium intake and Ca:P ratio of 1:l is recommended for adeq uate \\nbone mass. \\n\\uf0b7 Iron: The maintenance requirements are computed same as adul ts i.e. 14 (g/kg BW). For children up to 12 years of \\nage, the growth and blood expansion requirements are 15 mcg/kg of BW. Thus, 29 mcg/kg BW is recommen ded until \\n12 years of age. Talking into account an absorption figure of 3%, the daily dietary iron requirements are computed for \\ndifferent body weights at different ages of growing child.\"),\n",

In view of high vitamin A deficiency in India \\nand low serum levels, ICMR 1990 recommends 600 mg of retinol to schoolchildren and adolescents. \\n\\uf0b7 Other fat-soluble vitamins: ICMR (1990) does not give recommendations for vitamin D, E and K. Vitamin D is very \\nimportant for skeletal growth and optional utilization or calcium and phosphorus. School children a nd adolescents, \\nwho spend plenty of time in outdoor games in school or home, get vitamin D by bioconversions \\n\\uf0b7 Water-soluble vitamins: Thiamin is computed as 0.5 mg/1000 Kcal, riboflavin as 0.6 mg/1000 Kcal and niacin as 6.6 \\nmg niacin equivalents/1000 Kcal, as is done for adults. Folate requirements are computed on per kg body weight basis \\n.Vitamin B12 requirement ranges between 0.2 -1.0 mcg/d and needs to be ascertained age wise, if any. In absence of \\nprecise data on vitamin C requirements of Indian children and adolescents, a value of 40 mg/d is sufficient for all ages \\n1-18 years and adults. Vitamin C is heat labile and destroyed on storage. Its adequacy is important ev eryday for \\nenhancing availability of iron from diets. \\n5.3.3 Diet and feeding patterns \\nStarting school (especially full-time) can bring a number of changes in a child's eating habits. A large part of the child's time \\nwill be spent in school. Therefore, the meal timings should be adjusted according to the child's schedule. One must see that \\nthe child has a good breakfast. A hungry child cannot concentrate and participate fully in the learning ex perience. Not only \\ncereal but also a protein -rich food and a fruit which supplies some vitamin C should be included at breakfast time. Good \\nbreakfast helps in attention span, good social behavior, sense of security and contentment and prevent snacking and \\nbingeing. Yet most schoolchildren and adolescents rush through their breakfast or completely skip it . One common reason \\nfor skipping breakfast is sleeping l ate and rising-late. Pressure of school routine puts them into a rushed morning routine. \\nThey are not able to regain adequate appetite in this rushed routine in the morning. Adequacy of chi ldren's food and \\nnutrient intake depends on: \\n1.  Sibling company \\n2. Peer pressure \\n3. Model set by parents and other adults in the family their personal attitudes and practices. Sometime  they have \\nknowledge but cannot translate into practice. \\n4. Harmony at home and stress of school \\n5. Mass media \\n6. Convenience foods and fast food outlets. \\n \\nWe often find that a child becomes so involved with other activities that it is difficult to get him /her to sit down and eat. In \\naddition, when we force them they may eat a little and rush back to whatever they were doing. Later they may feel hungry, \\nand want a snack. If we do give snacks, we should encourage the child to eat nutritious ones instead of chocolates or chips. \\nIn the daily diet we must include 2 to 3 servings of fruits or vegetables, green leafy or yellow vegetables about 3 to 4 times a \\nweek. We must make sure that we  include a citrus fruit or some other good source of ascorbic acid. Many ch ildren may \\ndislike vegetables. However, we must try to get them to eat these foods. One way of doing so is by p reparing colorful, \\nattractive, tasty dishes. Another important aspect is that at this age, they may need to eat four or five times a day. \\nPermanent teeth start erupting at about 6 years. One must guard against caries formation in children  at any age but \\nespecially in schoolchildren because they have permanent teeth. Caries formation occurs because of poor dental hygiene \\nespecially after consumption of sweet foods. One  can prevent this by ensuring that the child brushe s and cleans his teeth \\nwell in the morning and night. Also, we must not give too man y sweet foods. For most children, lunchtime is during school \\nhours. We already know that the lunch provides the child with one-third of his/her daily nutrient needs. So most of the time \\nmothers will have to provide a packed lunch for the child.  \\nLet us discuss a few points to keep in mind while planning a packed lunch. \\n1)  It should be easy to eat and not spill over or leak. Avoid any oily or liquid preparations (unless i t is separately \\npackedin a bottle). Oil and liquid will leak out of the box and spill o ver children's books. Chutneys, etc. should be as \\ndry as possible. \\n2)  Let the food be as dry as possible (the child may/may not have a place to sit down and eat and wash hands as he can \\nat home). \\n3)  Many things that taste good when they are hot are not s o tasty when they are cold. A packed lunch will always be \\ncold. Hence, it should be prepared accordingly.\"),\n",

In this period, not only will a \\nboy or girl attain physiological maturity, but the adolescent also becomes increasingly independent and tries to be an adult. \\nThis period in lasts nearly a decade. It is a critical period since development of the indiv idual occurs at the physiological, \\npsychological and social levels. Adolescence is the time that begins with the onset of puberty. At t he end of adolescence, \\nthe individual has functional reproductive organs and has attained final physical growth i.e., wil l not grow any further. \\nPuberty or pubescence begins with the appearance of secondary sex characteristics. In girls, this shows development of the \\nbreast, beginning of the menstrual period etc. In boys, there is development of the genitals, appear ance of the facial hair \\netc. In both sexes, hair begins to grow in the under arms. At the end of puberty, sexual reproductio n becomes possible. \\nAdolescence follows puberty and ends with the completion of physical growth at maturity. Thus, at ad olescence, a girl is \\ncapable of bearing a child. \\n5.4.1 Growth and development \\nWHO defines 10- 18 years children as adolescents. Adolescence is a period of second growth spurt after infancy. Growth \\nspurt refers to a sudden increase in the rate of growth. The rate of growth is not constant in both sexes.  In both sexes, it \\noccurs in spurts. \\nGrowth and development in children can be studied under the following heads: \\n\\uf0b7 Changes in physical development and body composition \\n\\uf0b7 Sexual maturity \\n\\uf0b7 Psychosocial changes'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='118 \\n \\nChanges in physical development and body composition \\nAdolescence is one of the most challenging periods in human development. Adolescence is a period of second growth spurt \\nafter infancy. Most girls begin the adolescent growth spurt between the age of 10 and 13 years, and boys between the age \\nof 12 and 15 years. Nearly every organ in the body grows during this period of rapid growth. Most noticeable are increas es \\nin height and weight and development of secondary sexual characteristics. During the growth spurt, g irls gain about 25 c m \\nheight and boys 30 cm height. From age 10 years, girls tend to accumulate both lean body mass (LBM) and fat, whereas, \\nboys tend to gain mostly lean tissue. The growth in LBM corresponds to increase in spontaneous physi cal activity in boys \\nand increase in work capacity and heart volume. \\nBoys double their LBM while girls increase by 1.5 fold. Height gain is essentially complete by 19 ye ars. Head size in \\nproportion to total height shrinks from 114\" to 118\" between infancy to adulthood. Growth ceases in girls and boys when \\nskeleton reaches its final size. Once the growth spurt ceases in girls, which is 2 years after menarche, an adequate nutrient \\nintake will help maintain health and lead to increased weight by allowing normal cellular hypertrophy. \\nSexual Maturity \\nSexual maturity develops along with growth spurt in adolescence. In girls, growth stops on attaining  menarche (puberty). \\nThe other changes seen in sexual maturity of girls is development of breasts, axillary hair and pubi c hair. Menarche occurs \\nonly after this growth. In boys, changes in sexual maturity and growth go together. The secondary sexual changes are \\ndeepening of the voice, broadening of shoulders, developing axillary, body and\\' pubic hair. There are distinct changes in the \\nhormones. Sex hormones determine thermo genesis, moods, food intake and body composition. \\nPsychosocial Changes \\nAdolescence is a period of maturation for both mind and body. Along with thephysic4 growth, emotiona l and intellectual \\ndevelopments are rapid. The child develops g radually the ability to reason, develop problem -solving skills, and attain \\nemotional maturity. Adolescence marks a major shift from protected parental care to move into adult life pattern. During \\nthis transition, they try to build self -identity. Adolescent s often feel uncomfortable with their rapidly changing bodies. \\nDeveloping an image of the physical self is intertwined with nutritional issues. There is tremendous  peer pressure. Peer \\npressure and some adult idol determine their food habits, dressing and g roup conduct. There is a tremendous impact of \\nmass media on this age group. \\n5.4.2 Nutrient needs and RDA \\nThis period of growth is less predictable than at other ages, i.e., some teenagers may have their growth spurt at 11-12 years \\nof age and others at 14 y ears. Their requirements are determined by sex and sometimes even within the same sex, age, \\nstage of puberty and growth rate are important factors, which determine the nutritional requirements . Recommended \\nallowances of the Indian Council of Medical Resear ch are based on chronological age. Adolescence is divided into 2 age \\ngroups: 13 to15 years and 16 to 18 years. \\nRefer to Table 5.4.2 for Recommended dietary allowances of nutrients in adolescents \\nIn adolescence, maintenance and growth requirements can be computed separately for energy and protei n. We know that \\nfood and nutrient needs are going to be proportionately higher during the growth spurt. Enough cerea ls and protein \\ncontaining foods like dal s or milk, meat/fish/egg and also leafy vegetables and other fruits and vegetables are very \\nimportant. They provide minerals like calcium, which is important for development of bones and iron for blood formation \\nalong with vitamins A and C. During the adolescent growth spurt (for about 18 to 24 months), when the growth rate is at its \\nmaximum, the nutritional requirements of the teenager may be twice as much as during the rest of the  adolescent period. \\nNutrient requirements of course will parallel their grow th. However, energy requirements as we already know will depend \\nupon the amount of activity the teenager is involved in. During this period the need for all mineral s increases but three of \\nthem are particularly important. They are --calcium (for increased s keletal mass), iron (for the expansion of blood volume) \\nand zinc (for the development of sexual organs and generation of new skeletal and muscular tissue). Girls need more iron \\nthan boys do because of iron losses in blood during menstruation. The best way we can determine whether the teenager is \\nreceiving sufficient nutrition is to see whether he/she is growing well, see whether he/she is eating a well balanced diet and \\nwhether he/she feels healthy and has stamina. If a teenager is constantly falling ill or  feels tired continuously, there is \\nreason to worry. \\n5.4.3 Diet and feeding patterns \\nJust like schoolchildren, adolescents’ adequacy of food and nutrient intake depends on: \\n\\uf0b7 Sibling company \\n\\uf0b7 Peer pressure \\n\\uf0b7 Model set by parents and other adults in the family'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"119 \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Harmony at home and stress of school \\n\\uf0b7 Mass media \\n\\uf0b7 Convenience foods and fast food. \\nFor adolescents, other than points covered above, there are two more important points to be considered. They are: \\n\\uf0b7  Inanition \\n\\uf0b7 Fad diets \\nInanition actually refers to exhaustion f rom lack of nourishment; starvation. Many teenagers rarely relate today's food \\nhabits to tomorrow's health. They have a notion of 'desirable' body shape and 'ideal' body weight. They purposefully starve \\nto maintain such a weight. Very often they might miss  meals at home, often skipping breakfast and lunch altogether, \\nwhereas during this time of peak growth velocity, adolescents usually need to eat often and in large amounts. \\nOn the other hand, fad diets are common especially among boys. Girls resort to fad diets in order to lose weight and \\nadolescent boys for muscle building, broadening shoulders, waist narrowing etc.  \\nProblems that effect feeding patterns and nutrition are: \\n1. Obesity: One problem is that a diet which consists of high calorie foods only may lead to obesity. If a teena ger is \\noverweight, he/she is made fun of. This may affect the psychological and social maturation of the adolescent. \\nEventually obesity will alter metabolic  function and lead to elevation of blood pressure and raise levels of \\ntriglycerides, glucose etc. leading to high risk of heart disease, when he becomes an adult. \\n2. Acne: Adolescents of both sexes dread pimples and the problems of a bad complexion. There are  many fads and \\nfallacies regarding their causes and treatment. The real cause is that the sebaceous glands which pr oduce oil and \\nlubricate the skin, are under hormonal control. In puberty, hormone production increases greatly thus, leading to \\nacne. The best thing is to have a well balanced diet and combine it with good skin care. \\n3. Alcohol: Teenagers may drink alcohol for fun in the company of friends. What they must take care of is that it should \\nnot become an addiction. Alcohol is not a food. Moreover, it a dversely affects appetite and nutritional status of an \\nindividual. \\n4. Diabetes: A diabetic adolescent (juvenile diabetes) must be given insulin and it is important that he/she is p rovided \\nwith a normal and nutritionally adequate diet. The diet should be satis fying and flexible enough or else the teenager \\nwill find it very hard to adhere to it. \\n5. Teenage pregnancy : Families: who are not financially well off, get their teenage daughters married off at a very \\nearly. As a result, many adolescent girls become pregnant. Nutritional needs during this time should be taken care of \\nso that the pregnant teenager has enough food for her and her baby's growth. \\nWe may encounter adolescents who suffer from other health problems like asthma, atherosclerosis and bone disorders etc. \\nFor each of the conditions we must take adequate and appropriate care under a doctor's guidance so t hat there will be no \\ndetrimental effects on his/her health in the future. \\nSimple nutritious diet, rich in iron, plenty of fruits and vegetables, low fat and low sucrose diet with plenty of exercise and \\nsports can in fact ensure good physique and long term good health. \\nRefer to table no.5.4.3 for balanced diet for adolescents \\nSample items on a menu for an adolescent: \\n \\n \\n1)  Paneer parantha with fruit. \\n2)  Sprout upma/poha with fruit/sprout chat. \\n3)  Missi parantha with vegetable (as carrot, peas, pumpkin, aloo methi). \\n4)  Palak/bathua/methi/missi parantha with oil-free lemon-ginger pickle. \\n5)  Vegetable and peanut idli with chutney. \\n6)  Paneer and vegetable pulao. \\n7)  Vegetable and nugget noodles (avoid plain noodles), \\n8)  Rajma/paneer low fat patties\"),\n",

They occupy a critical place in the life cycle and have health and \\nsocial importance for individuals, families and society. This intergenerational significance has led all soc ieties lo recognize \\nthese as special periods and to make provisions for their care. We shall first discuss about pregnan cy and the impact of \\nnutrition on it.  \\nA normal pregnancy, as you know, lasts for 9 months or 270 days, approximately. During this time, the baby grows from \\nbeing as tiny as a pinhead to a weight of almost 2.5 to 3 kg. During the period of fetal growth in the mother's womb, the \\nfetus is nour ished directly by the mother herself, through a spongy structure called the Placenta. Since the baby  relies \\ntotally upon its mother for nourishment, you realise how vital it is to provide a pregnant woman with an adequate well \\nbalanced diet. \\n5.5.1  Growth and development \\nA completely new life begins at conception. Organ systems develop rapidly and nutrition plays many s upportive roles. \\nPregnancy from conception to birth usually lasts 40weeks (10 lunar months/menstrual cycles) in human s. During this \\nperiod, the unborn child grows from a single cell to an infant that is ready for life outside the womb. Many physical changes \\nalso take place in the mother to support her developing offspring, regulate her own (maternal) metabolism and prepare her \\nfor labor, birth  and lactation. Changes in the mother are anatomical, physiological and complex, affecting almost eve ry \\nfunction of the body. They are an integral part of the maternal - fetal system, which creates the most favorable \\nenvironment possible for the developing child. Many of these changes are apparent in the very early weeks. \\nIt is necessary to conduct biochemical tests at suitable intervals such as in the first, second and third trimesters, to follow \\nthese changes and determine if there is a deviation that cal ls for an intervention. The most common measurement of \\nnutritional importance done routinely in India is hemoglobin in the second and third trimesters. Mea surement of blood \\npressure and fundal height are other two measurements done routinely to determine h igh-risk pregnancies and \\ndevelopment of the fetus.  \\nLot of hormonal changes happen during pregnancy like: \\n\\uf0b7 Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)  begins to increase immediately on implantation of the ovum and reaches a \\npeak at around 8 weeks of gestalion. HCG maintains the corpus luteum which is the main source of oes trogens and \\nprogesterone in the early weeks of pregnancy. \\n\\uf0b7 Human placental lactogen , with a structure similar to the growth hormone, increases throughout pregnancy. \\nPlacental lactogen stimulates lipolysis and is important in maintaining a flow of substrates to the foetus. Placental \\nlactogen along with prolactin also promotes the development of mammary glands. \\n\\uf0b7 Oestrogens and progesterone  are secreted by the placenta from 8 -10 weeks of gestation. It stimulates maternal \\nrespiration ensuring an adequate supply of oxygen to the foetus. 1n addition, it relaxes smooth musc le in the uterus \\nto accommodate the growing foetus and allow for childbirth. Progesterone, while stimulating lobular development in \\nthe breast, inhibits milk secretion during pregnancy.\"),\n",

Cortisol enhances production of \\nglucose from amino acids (gluconeogenesis) and also antagonizes the action of insulin. This way it i ncreases the \\navailability of glucose to the foetus which relies solely on glucose for its energy needs. \\nPlacental Transfer of Nutrients \\nAlso called the lifeline for the foetus, t he placenta is a  transitory structure which develops during pregnancy and lies \\nimplanted on the uterine wall. It is connected with the foetus through the umbilical cord. The foetus derives all its nutrition \\nfrom the mother across the placental barrier. If the consumption, absorption and utilization of the nutrients  by the mother \\nand the transport of nutrients across the placental barrier are inadequate, then foetal malnutrition  develops. Dietary \\ninadequacies are a ma jor cause of fetal under nutrition in developing countries. Maternal diseases such as diabetes and \\nhypertension compromise the delivery of nutrients across the placenta to the fetus. \\nRole of the placenta in fetal nutrition \\n \\nNourishes the fetus \\n \\nRemoves wastes \\n \\nFetal lung \\n \\n \\nProtective barrier \\n \\n \\n \\nEndocrine gland \\n \\nFacilitates transfer of oxygen and nutrients from \\nmother to foetus. \\npicks up fetal waste products such as CO2, urea, \\nbilirubin. \\nperforms the respiratory, absorptive and excretory \\nfunctions that the fetus lungs, digestive system and \\nkidneys will provide after birth. \\nprotects the fetus from harmful agents, which \\nare of high molecular weight including proteins except \\nmaternal immuo globulin G  conferring immunity to the \\nfetus. \\nproduces several hormones t hat maintain pregnancy \\nand prepare the mother's breasts for lactation. \\n \\nMaternal Weight Gain: A  pregnant woman must gain about 7 to 10 kg during the entire pregnancy. Ideally, a mother \\nshould begin her pregnancy at the appropriate weight for her height. It is advisable that during the  first three months, a \\npregnant woman should put on approximately 1 to 2 kg. Thereafter, her weight gain should be at the rate of about 2 kg per \\nmonth. Maternal weight gain represents two major components.  \\n1)    The products of conception i.e. the fetus, amniotic fluid and the placenta  \\n2)    Maternal tissues gained, expansion of blood and extracellular fluid, enlargement of uterus and mammary glands and \\nmaternal stores (adipose tissue).  \\nThese physiological changes contribute towards the increased nutrient demands on the nutritional sta tus of the expectant \\nmother. \\nIn India, the weight gain during pregnancy for the upper economic group is 11kg and, the lower economic group women is \\nonly 6-7 kg. Lower weight gain is associated with increased risk of intrauterine growth retardation and perinatal mortality. It \\nis useful to d efine certain terms here. When a baby is born full term, i.e. 39 -40 weeks of gestation but has a weight less \\nthan 2.5 kg, the baby is referred to as a low birth weight (LBW) baby but if a baby is born prior to full term and weighs less \\nthan 2.5 kg, it is not to be classified as low birth weight or small for date. Such babies are pre maturely born. \\n \\nRefer to Table no.5.5.1 for Distribution of weight gained during pregnancy \\n5.5.2 Nutrient needs and RDA \\n\\uf0b7 Energy: During pregnancy, a woman needs more amount of almost every nutrient. The calorie requirement \\nincreases by 15% or more.  The ICMR has recommended that a pregnant woman's intake should be 300 Kcal more \\nthan her normal intake in the second half of pregnancy. This is because the baby grows very rapidly, in the second \\nhalf of pregnancy.  The composition of the diet during pregnancy should be the same as for a non -pregnant \\nwoman; hence, the contribution to calories from carbohydrat e, protein and fat does not change. However, \\ncarbohydrate intake should not be <100 g per day. Pregnant adolescent girls, underweight women and w omen \\nwho are exceptionally active (heavy physical activity) may require more energy.\"),\n",

A mother should take about 14 gm of \\nprotein more than a normal woman during the second half of pregnancy.. This increase could be either through \\nvegetarian sources such as pulses (soybean), milk and milk products (cheese) or through meat/fish an d eggs in the \\ndiet. This is based on the needs of the non -pregnant woman plus th e extra amounts needed for growth. Maternal \\nand foetal growth accelerates in the second month and the rate progressively increases until just be fore term. \\nTherefore, the need for protein follows this growth rate. It is important to ensure protein quality, as well as, quantity. \\nThe physically active pregnant women and adolescent girls would however require more as compared to sedentary \\npregnant woman. \\n\\uf0b7 Micronutrients: Minerals and vitamins are necessary for growth, for formation of red blood cells, formation of bones \\nand teeth and development of the nervous system. Since energy intake increases, the requirements for  few \\nmicronutrients needed for energy utilization i.e. thiamin, niacin, riboflavin and magnesium also inc rease. Since \\nprotein needs are higher, the  requirements for vitamin B6 and zinc also increase. Micronutrients involved in the \\ngrowth and development of bone and connective tissue and the synthesis of new cells are needed in gr eater \\namounts. \\nRefer to table no.5.5.2b for RDIs during pregnancy \\nRefer to table no.5.5.2c for iron requirement during pregnancy \\nCommon concerns during pregnancy: \\nHigh Risk Pregnancies:- these happen due to pregnancy related problems such as: \\n\\uf0b7 Anemia in Pregnancy \\n\\uf0b7 Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy \\n\\uf0b7 Pregnancy and Diabetes Mellitus \\n\\uf0b7 Pregnancy and Obesity and \\n\\uf0b7 Adolescent Pregnancy \\n \\n5.5.3 Diet and feeding patterns \\nAn adequate diet is very important so that the placenta grows well in order that the baby will receive all the nourishment it \\nneeds. If a woman has gained more than the expected amount of weight early in pregnancy, she should be advised not  to \\nput on too much weight. However, she should not drastically curtail her diet. It is important to know why weigh t gain is so \\nimportant during pregnancy. She may give birth to an unde rweight baby. This may not be a serious problem if the baby is \\nsmall, alert and healthy. However, a low birth weight baby is usually also malnourished and weak. Su ch a baby may not be \\nstrong enough to get all the nourishment it needs by suckling. It may no t be able to cry loudly and vigorously to attract its \\nmother's attention. If a pregnant woman does not consume enough food early in pregnancy, growth of t he placenta and \\ntherefore the baby's growth may be less than normal. A weak baby girl, when she become s an adult (presuming that she is \\nwell-nourished throughout her childhood) grows to be smaller in stature and so may in turn bear an unders ized or poorly \\ndeveloped infant. Such an infant will not be able to achieve its full potential. Thus, the food that a  woman eats and her \\nnutritional status affect the health of her children and the future of her family. \\n Refer to table no. 5.5.3 Prediction of low birth weight on the basis of BMI of mother \\nDaily Food Guide for the Pregnant Woman \\n \\nFoods \\nNo. of extra servings \\nto be taken by a pregnant \\nwoman \\n\\uf0b7 Cereals and Millets \\n\\uf0b7 Dals/Egg/Milk/Meat/Fish \\n\\uf0b7 Protective Vegetables and Fruits \\n                 (vitamin C rich) \\n\\uf0b7 Dark green leafy Vegetables \\n\\uf0b7 Other Vegetables and Fruits \\n+2 \\n+2 \\n+1 \\n \\n+1 \\n+1\"),\n",

As long as these cravings do not interfere with \\ngood eating habits and are not health hazards, we need not worry about it. Some women crave for amla, raw tamarind, etc. \\nThese foods are nutritious (good sources of vitamin C) and should be eaten. \\nSome women have nausea (feel sick) or morning sickness in early pregnancy. Eating snacks often helps  to prevent and \\novercome this problem. \\n5.6 Lactation \\nLactation is a physiological process, which has profound relevance for b oth the mother and the newborn. It is the period \\nfollowing pregnancy when the woman nourishes a fully developed and a rapidly growing baby with breas t milk. A lactating \\nwoman secretes about 500 ml milk/day in the first month, which increases to about 850 m l/day by the fifth month. On an \\naverage, a well -nourished lactating woman secretes about 850 ml/day. During pregnancy, changes occur in the mother's  \\nbreasts to prepare for milk production and body fat is deposited to ensure that energy is available for lactation. \\nLactogenesis is the onset of copious milk secretion around parturition, triggered by a fall in plasma progesterone  levels. \\nAlthough some colostrums is secreted after delivery (2-3 days), full lactation begins later. The first 2-3 days after delivery is \\na period of rapid lactation initiation, followed by the longer period of maintenance of lactation. T his complex \\nneuroendocrine process is facilitated by interplay of various hormones.  Oxytocin and prolactin instigate the lactation \\nprocess. Prolactin is responsible for milk production and oxytocin is involved in milk ejection from the breast. \\n5.6.1 Human milk composition \\nHuman milk contains several nutrients and that it is tailor made to meet the requirements of the growing infant. Nature has \\ndesigned milk to be species -specific. Thus, human milk is unique to the needs of the young homosapiens. The value of \\nhuman milk for the health and growth of the baby is undisputed and rarely does br eastfeeding need to be discouraged. \\nHuman milk is a solution of proteins, sugar and inorganic compounds in which a variety of fatty acids are suspended.  \\nRefer to table no. 5.6.1 for the nutritional composition of human milk.  \\nMilk composition varies betwe en mothers (inter -individual variation) from one period of lactation to the next (intra -\\nindividual variation) and even within a single 24-hourperiod (diurnal variation) and the time during the feed, as well as, the \\nbreast. The composition of milk is also r elated to the amount secreted, timing of withdrawal and individual variations, \\nwhich includes maternal age, parity, health and socio-economic status. Gestational age of the infant also affects, since milk \\nfrom in others of premature infants has higher concentrations of some nutrients as compared to milk from mothers of term \\ninfants. Similarly, diet and use of oral contraceptives may also influence composition. \\nSpecial characteristics of colostrum, beneficial to the infant are summarized herein: \\n1. Volume of colostrum :2 -10 ml/feeding/day - related in part to the parity of the mother \\n2. Typically yellow, due to a relatively high carotene content \\n3. Transparent, contains more protein, less sugar and much less fat \\n4. Lower in calories than mature milk (58kcal vs. 70 kcal/100 ml) \\n5. Concentration of sodium, potassium, and chloride greater than in mature milk \\n6. Facilitates establishment of 'bifidobacteria' in the gastrointestinal tract of newborn \\n7. Facilitates passage of meconium in the newborn's intestines \\n8. Contains abundant antibodies which provides passive immunity for infant. \\nSome characteristics that make breastfeeding beneficial to the infant are : \\n\\uf0b7 Mature human milk contains about 1/3rd the protein found in cow's milk - more than 25% of its nitrogen is non -\\nprotein nitrogen. The concentration of casein to whey protein is lower; 1.5 for breast milk and 0.2 for cow's  milk. \\nThus, human milk with its low casein content forms a flocculent suspension with a curd tension of 0.  These curds are \\neasily digested and hence better tolerated by the infant. \\n\\uf0b7 Lactoferrin in human milk inhibits the growth of certain iron-dependent bacteria in the GI tract and therefore affords \\nprotection against gastrointestinal infections. \\n\\uf0b7  Protection from respiratory tract allergy and eczema. \\n\\uf0b7 Immunoglobulins provide passive immunity and protect against infection by retarding viral and bacterial inva sion of \\nthe mucosa. \\n\\uf0b7 Relatively low in amino acids that are detrimental at high levels.  \\n\\uf0b7 It  has a threefold higher fat content.

T herefore, the \\nrelationship between .maternal nutritional status and lactation performance is important. Successful breastfeeding requires \\nadequate nutrition and rest. For adequate lactation, substrates must be available in sufficient quan tities from the mother's \\ndiet or body stores laid down during pregnancy. If these are insufficient, some degree of subsidy from maternal body tissue \\ncan be expected. We know that the simplest evidence of tissue depletion is weight loss. In a sense, pregnancy and lactation \\nneed to be considered as a continuum.  However, the longer the duration of lactation, the greater would be the impact on \\nthe mother's nutritional status. \\nStudies indicate that there are major physiological alterations in calcium and bone metabolism durin g lactation, \\nindependent of maternal calcium intake. Bone resorption and bone formations are high, particularly in the 1st 3-6 months of \\nlactation. \\nAmong well -nourished women, weight loss can occur after childbirth, although this depends on their caloric inta ke and \\ntheir physical activity. In poorer communities, die tary intakes of breastfeeding mothers are not very different from non -\\nlactating women. The RDIs for all major nutrients are given for the first 6 months of lactation, as well as, the second 6 \\nmonths of lactation, when the volume of milk produced has decrea sed. However, women who have a low pre pregnancy \\nweight gain, who have decreased weight for height and who breastfeed more than one infant, need addi tional kilocalories \\nduring lactation. FAO/WHO 2004 recommends that well-nourished women with adequate gesta tional weight gain should \\nincrease their food intake by 505 Kcal/day for the first six months of lactation, while undernourished women and those with \\ninsufficient gestational weight gain should add to their personal energy demands 675 Kcal/day during the first six months of \\nlactation. Energy requirements for milk production in the second six months are dependent on rate of  milk production, \\nwhich are highly variable among women and populations. \\nThe nutrient needs of a lactating mother. \\nEnergy and Protein Needs: Remember that during pregnancy, well-nourished women will have laid down approximately 2-\\n4 kg of fat. This can be mobilized to supply a portion of the additional energy for lactation. It is  estimated that this amount \\nof storage fat will provide 200 -300 Kcal/day for a period of three months. However, this amount represents only a part of \\nthe energy cost of milk production. \\nThe additional protein intake suggested in Table 13.9 not only takes into account the additional pro tein needs but also the \\nnet protein utilization of Indian diets, \\nThe requirement of several micronutrients also increases and is summarized herewith. \\nMicronutrient: Vitamin and mineral deficiencies can have profound influence on the composition of milk. Calcium is a \\nnutrient of special concern, since there are some reports in the literature that if the mother's diet is not adequate, it will be \\nmobilized from her bones. This is especially of concern in case of prolonged lactation. Hence, the R DI for calcium is high for \\nlactating mothers. \\nThe requirements for other nutrients are all increased, reflecting the need for milk production and th e need to replenish \\nmaternal stores. Folate needs are increased above non-pregnant levels but are not as high as during pregnancy. Iron needs \\nare not increa sed during lactation because little iron is lost in milk, and in most women, losses are decreased be cause \\nmenstruation is absent. However, if the mother's iron status is poor, supplements of 30 mg of elemen tal iron per day may \\nbe recommended for the first 2 to 3 months of lactation to replete iron stores. \\nRefer to table no.5.6.2 for RDIs for lactating mothers \\nBesides these, water needs during lactation should be paid attention to. An increase in fluid intake  does not increase milk \\nvolume, however, additiona l fluid is needed to maintain a normal maternal fluid balance. When fluid intake is low, the \\nmother's urine becomes more concentrated to conserve water for milk production. To avoid dehydration  and ensure \\nadequate milk production, fluid intake should be increased by about 1lt per day.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"125 \\n \\n5.6.3 Diet and feeding patterns \\nGenerally, a well -'balanced diet meets nutrient needs of the mother. Whenever feasible, food should be the source of \\nnutrients and self -initiated vitamin and mineral supplements should be avoided. The dietary intake of caffeine, artificial \\nsweeteners and alcohol must be totally avoided. This is because most chemicals ingested by the lactating mother cross into \\nthe milk. Therefore, the mother should seek the advice of her physician before ta king any dietary supplement, medication \\nor drugs. Excess caffeine may make the infant irritable and wakeful, but the research indicates that  moderate amounts of \\ncaffeine (1 -2 cups of coffee per day) will not harm or upset the infant. Further, infants metab olize alcohol inefficiently. \\nSmoking also reduces milk volume. Infant exposure to passive smoke negates the protective effect of breastfeeding and \\noffers against sudden infant death syndrome. \\nFoods with a strong flavour may alter the flavour of milk. A few  infants may be sensitive to particular foods like cow's milk \\nprotein. Hence, when the mother's diet includes such foods, the infant may experience discomfort. In  general, the mother \\ncan eat whatever she likes. However, if she suspects that a particular fo od is causing the infant discomfort, she should \\nconsult the physician. If the food is eliminated for an extended time, appropriate foods should be s ubstituted to ensure \\nnutrient adequacy. During the period of nursing or breastfeeding one can notice that a mother needs to consume one-and-\\na-half times her normal food intake.  \\nSample menu for a nursing mother \\nFoods                                                                                         Amount \\nChapati or                                                                                         One \\nRice                                                                                                    One cup \\nDal or                                                                                                 One cup \\nEgg or                                                                                                One \\nMilk/curd or                                                                                     One cup \\nFish or                                                                                                One piece \\nNuts                                                                                                   25 gm \\nAny dark green leafy vegetable                                                    One serving \\nGhee/butter/oil/fat                                                                         4-5tsps \\nSugar/jaggery                                                                                   4-5tsps \\n \\nWe are familiar with the traditions of feeding special preparations to a nursing mother.

We can meet the additional requirements of the mot her by increasing \\nsome common food items in the normal diet which provide the same nutrients. \\n5.6 Old age \\nAgeing is a continuous process. It starts at birth and continues throughout our life. This process though is hastened in later \\nyears of life. \\nHere we will focus on the vital relationship between nutrition and ageing discuss the current nutrit ional recommendations \\nfor healthy ageing. One of the fundamental and unavoidable facts of life is that our body composition changes with age. It \\nchanges from the way it looks to the way it functions. Externally, the hair greys, skin wrinkles, eyes and ears also go through \\ntheir own degeneration. Inte rnally, many physiological changes occur and practically all the tissues and organs decline in \\ntheir functional efficiency over time. Also no two persons of sixty or sixty -five years look alike. Some may look ten years \\nyounger, others a few years older than they are. In other words, their actual age, which is also known as chronological age, \\ndoes not coincide with their biological age. However, the chronological age is most often used by ge rontologists to define \\nthe aged. In India, a cut-off age of 60 years is taken for classifying people as 'old' and is used for census purposes. \\nMany nations follow the cuts off age at 60 years while many developed countries and United Nations take the cut-off age at \\n65 years to designate the elderly. In India, socio-economic development along with better health facilities and medical care \\nincluding primary health services has raised the life expectancy. At present, the elderly constitute  7.7% of the total \\npopulation i.e. approximately 76 million and are projected to reach ab out 150 million (12 percent) by the year 2025. The\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"126 \\n \\nelderly population is a very heterogeneous group, which has varying problems and needs. We can class ify the elderly into \\ntwo groups, the 'young old' (i.e. 60 to 74 years)  and 'old old' (i.e. 75 years plus) , Men outnumber women in young old age \\ngroups and women outnumber men in the higher old ages. The Indian population projections reveal an i mpending burden \\nof elderly care in the near future. Our health planners will have to give more attention to the prev entive and health \\npromotion for the elderly. This would help to improve their quality of life and reduce morbidity lev els so that they live \\npurposefully and independently within the community. \\n5.6.2 Changes in ageing \\nAs we grow older, our body is the sum total of the care, use, misuse or neglect it has undergone. Th e illnesses or diseases \\nthat we may have suffered also leave their mark. If we had accidents, the cumulative effect of these  on the body is also felt \\nin old age. Infections like diarrhea, dysentery, fevers etc. that we may have suffered due to environmental factors also leave \\ntheir mark on certain systems of the body. How well the need of the body was met by foods we ate thr oughout the years \\naffects not only the ageing process, but also our resistance to disease. \\n\\uf0b7 Physiological changes: Many changes occur in our body, mind, social and economic status with age.  The digestive \\nsystem undergoes considerable change with age. The amount of acid and digestive enzymes secreted by gastric  glands \\ndecreases. Thus, the digestion and absorption of nutrients is decreased. About 10 per cent of the elderly suffer from \\nreduced secretion of hydrochloric acid or gastric acid. This takes away the first line of defense of the body, since gastric acid \\nacts as an antiseptic also. As a result, they suffer from frequent diarrhea and stomach upsets due to increased infections. \\nThe movement of the alimentary tract becomes sluggish with age. Food stagnates, bowels do not move regularly and \\nconstipation is a common problem. It may have been treated with drugs over a period, further reducin g its activity. Proper \\nmastication helps the process of digesti on of food but with teeth fallen, decayed or functionless, food is often swallowed \\nthan chewed by the elderly. If they have poorly fitted dentures, they do not use them due to discomfort. The ability to smell \\nand note differences in taste reduces with age, which leads to decreased enjoyment of food. The progressive accumulation \\nof plaques leads to narrowing of the lumen of blood vessels and loss of elasticity. There is a decline in the cardiac output, an \\nincreased resistance to the flow of blood and resultant reduced capacity to respond to extra work. As the rate of blood flow \\nis reduced, the digestion, absorption and distribution of nutrients is retarded. Skeletal bone loss occurs with ageing and \\nmay have serious consequences among the elderly. With ageing,  there is thinning of bone tissues due to the loss of these \\nminerals. In some elderly, there is an abnormal thinning of bone tissue and as a result, osteoporosis develops. \\nFrom age 25 years, the basal metabolism decreases by about 2 percent for each decade due to the increasing proportion of \\nbody fat and lesser muscle tension. The ability to maintain normal body temperature is also lessened  and hypothermia in \\nthe elderly can be especially dangerous. \\nCarbohydrate metabolism: Glucose tolerance may be impaired to some extent. \\nUsually, the fasting blood sugar is normal. The absorption of carbohydrate is not impaired, however,  when a carbohydrate \\nload is presented, as in the glucose tolerance test, the blood sugar remains elevated for a longer period of time as \\ncompared to the younger persons. \\nFat metabolism: With increasing age, the blood cholesterol and blood triglyceride levels gradually increase. Certain  factors \\nlike the kind and amount of fat and carbohydrate in the diet, the degree of overweight, the stresse s of life may be \\nresponsible for the elevated levels. \\nChanging body composition: By 80 years, it is estimated that only half of the muscle cells remain. Connective tissue, which \\nis so abundant in the human body, sees many changes, which are of special sign ificance. Collagen is one of the fibrous \\nmaterials found in tendons, ligaments, skin and blood vessels. With ageing, the amount of collagen i ncreases and becomes \\nrigid, the skin loses its flexibility, the joints creak and the back becomes bent. Both longit udinal and cross-sectional studies \\nthroughout the world indicate that height decreases with age. The average reduction in height during  the total life span is \\nabout 2.9 cms in men and 4.9 cms in women, with approximately half the decrease being in sitting height. The reduction in \\nsitting height is a result of vertebral compression, change in shape and height of vertebral discs, loss of muscle tone and \\npostural changes. Weight loss in elderly is generally caused by a reduced lean body mass (LBM) and b ody fat  due to \\nmetabolic and physical changes associated with ageing or presence of disease conditions. The body wa ter content reduces \\nwith advancing age and this has been implicated as an important cause of decline in weight after 65 years. Studies also \\nshow a slow, progressive redistribution of fat in the elderly. The body fat relocates centrally and intra a bdominally, while \\nthe subcutaneous fat on the limbs tend to decrease. An increase in abdominal circumference with age may also reflect \\nshortening of trunk d ue to osteoporosis or other spinal deformities. As the length of the trunk decreases, the abdomen \\nincreases in girth.\"),\n",

A \\nconsideration of recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for older adults must recognize each of these  aspects of the \\nrelationship between nutrition and ageing. The Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) gradually decreases after the attainment of \\nmaturity due to a decrease in muscle mass tissues and physical activity. With an increase in age, the percentage r eduction \\nin the total energy requirement as recommended by \\nICMR is 20 percent for 60 to 69 years of age and 30 percent for 70 to 79 years of age and above, although there can be wide \\nindividual variations. The elderly need the same nutrients that they needed earlier. One change that definitely accompanies \\nthe ageing process is a decreased energy need. With age the basal metabolism and activities slow dow n. On an average, \\nmen and women in the 55 -75 years age group need 400 to 500 calories less per day than they did before this stage. The \\nneed for other nutrients is not altered. Therefore we do not find changes in recommendations for nutrients except energy. \\nRefer to table no.5.6.2a  for recommended dietary allowances of nutrients for the elderly \\nThe metabolic demand for vitamin B, to maintain glucose tolerance and \\nnormal cognitive function in older adults is higher than the earlier consumption. Vitamin B6 and vitamin E supplementation \\nhelp to enhance the vigor of immune reactions which slow down with age. The efficiency in absorption  of vitamin B12 and \\nfolic acid in the gut may be reduced with age owing to the decrease in secretion of hydrochloric aci d in t he stomach of \\nmany elderly people. The capacity of the skin to synthesize vitamin D from sunlight and also kidney' s ability to convert \\nvitamin D to its biologically active form, declines with ageing process. \\nThe potential benefits of micro nutrients should  also be taken into account when the nutrient allowances are defined for \\nolder adults. The increase in the status of vitamin B6, BI2 and/or folate gives protection against elevations in homocysteine \\n– an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, d epression and certain deficits of neuro-cognitive function. A good \\nnutritional status of vitamin C, E and b-carotene (antioxidants) among healthy elderly have shown a reduced risk for cancer, \\ncataract and heart disease. \\nNutrients act as modulators of chronic disease risk. Therefore, it is more important for .the elderly to consume a diet rich in \\nantioxidant nutrients (vitamin A, C and E and selenium), B vitamins (folate, vitamin B6 and B12) and minerals like calcium, \\nto prevent chronic disease, rather than consuming just the amount of nutrients that are needed to prevent a deficiency \\nstate from occurring. Strong links which have been made between specific nutrients and particular chronic illnesses. \\nRefer to table no.5.6.2 b for interactions between specific nutrients and chronic illness \\n5.6.4 Diet and feeding patterns \\nBalanced diets for elderly \\nThe key element in planning diets for the elderly should be nutrient-based dietary guidelines, in order to reduce the burden \\nof chronic disease afflicting this group by nutr itional means. The adults over 70 years generally consume less food than \\nyounger people primarily because of decrease in energy expenditure and distinctly different metaboli c processes. It is \\nimportant to note the following: \\n1. Foods that are nutrient dense in vitamins and minerals should be included. For example, whole grain and enriched or \\npossibly fortified bread should be preferred to refined grain products for provision of adequate amo unts of B \\nvitamins. This is especially important since cereals and bread comprise the bulk of the diet of elderly people, many of \\nwhom are at risk for malnutrition. \\n2.  In the fruit and vegetable category, deeply colored ones should be chosen for provision of folate an d antioxidant \\nnutrients. \\n3. In the milk and milk products group (curd, paneer, cheese) emphasis should be placed on low fat dairy products for \\nthe provision of adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D. \\n4.  From the protein rich group of meat, poultry, fish, beans, eggs and nuts groups, variety should be the key principle  \\nto follow with individual choices being made according to availability, affordability, chew ability,  individual and ease \\nof preparation. \\n5. Foods high in dietary fiber should be given and fluid intakes of elderly people should be emphasized  since thirst \\nsensation is decreased in older people. \\n6. For non-vegetarians, pulses can be exchanged for eggs or a portion of chicken or fish.\"),\n",

This could reduce the quantity \\nand quality of nutrition in them. It is better to provide elderly people without teeth with artificial dentures.

Due to \\nrestriction in calories, nutrient dense foods should be included in them to meet the nutrient requirements. \\n\\uf0b7 Small frequent meals, which are easy to prepare and digest, should be given. \\n\\uf0b7 The taste acquisition and sensation of smell decline in later years, so some pleasure derived from f ood is lost. It is, \\ntherefore, advisable that the meals should be made more attractive and appealing by including a variety of foods and \\ncolor to encourage or motivate them to eat. Every effort should be made to make food palatable, with out using \\nspices in excess. , \\n\\uf0b7 Overuse and sprinkling of table salt over preparations while eating should be avoided by the elderly. \\n\\uf0b7 Loss of teeth due to increased decay of teeth and gums is common in aged person. Ill fitting dentures may also make \\nchewing difficult. A change in the texture and method of food preparation is recommended. Consequent ly, well \\ncooked and soft meals must be included in the diet. Care must be taken to avoid too much of soft car bohydrate-rich \\nfoods and include foods that provide nutrients such as vitamins, proteins and minerals like calcium. \\n\\uf0b7 There is decreased secretion of saliva, which makes swallowing difficult. \\n Therefore, soups, vegetables with gravies, curds or raitas, dals etc.should be included in the meals  and very dry \\nmeals should be avoided. \\n Gastric acidity decreases with age. Peptic, tryptic, amylolytic and lipolytic activities of the digestive secretions are \\ndecreased. Reduced acid secretion and muscle weakness leads to delayed esophageal emptying, poor tol erance to \\nfat, distention, flatulence and constipation. A liberal intake of fibre and fluid (at least 8  glasses of water or non \\nalcoholic caffeine free beverages) should be consumed by an elderly .person to facilitate the digest ion process. \\nRoughage in the form of tender vegetables and fruits is beneficial against the problem of constipation.'),\n",

This \\nmay lead to anemia and may contribute to osteoporosis. Iron and calcium -rich food should be included in the daily \\ndietary intake. Elderly people also have to make a conscious effort of drinking water in order to remain well hydrated \\nespecially in warm climates. This is because their thirst mechanism is reduced with an increase in age. This also helps \\nto overcome the problem of constipation, which is a very common complaint during this age. \\n\\uf0b7 Energy intake should be sufficient to maintain normal weight without leading to obesity or weight lo ss. Under \\nnutrition is undesirable and on  the other hand obesity may lead to diabetes, coronary heart disease, gout and other \\ndegenerative disorders. \\n\\uf0b7 Small meals at frequent intervals should be consumed. Fats, oils, refined cereals and sweets should be consumed by \\nthe elderly. Dietary fat, if poorly tolerated may be reduced. \\n\\uf0b7 Elderly need more calcium, iron, zinc, antioxidant nutrients like b -carotene, vitamin E and C to prevent age -related \\ndiseases. Inadequate diets of the elderly may need to be supplemented with pharmaceutical nutritiona l \\nsupplements. \\n\\uf0b7 The likes, dislikes and food preferences of the elderly should be considered while meal planning. Am ong elderly who \\nsuffer from chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertensions or heart disease, further dietary modifica tions may be \\nrequired. \\n\\uf0b7 Alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking should be completely avoided. \\n5.7 Summary \\n\\uf0b7 We learnt that infancy is one of the most rapid periods of growth in life. Human milk is ideally sui ted to the needs of \\nthe human infant. It is important to feed colostrum to the i nfant. In order to nurse her baby successfully, a mother \\nshould consume atleast one-and-a-half times her normal diet. After 5 to 6 months of age, milk alone is not sufficient \\nfor the baby's needs. Other foods, like semi-solids should be introduced into the infant's diet at this age. By one year \\nthe child should be able to eat most of the foods that are eaten by adults. When it is not possible to feed a baby with \\nmother's milk, cow's or buffalo's milk, can be used after suitable modification. \\n\\uf0b7 Growth in the s chool years occurs at a slow but steady pace. Except in the early school years, appetite of the \\nschoolchild is quite healthy. Nutrient requirements are in proportion to their growth rate and energ y requirements \\nand will vary according to their physical activity. If the schoolchild is malnourished, he/she will not be able to perform \\nwell in school. Providing adequate nutrition is important so that the child will be able to build up adequate nutrient \\nreserves, which will be needed during the adolescent growth spurt. \\n\\uf0b7 Adolescence is a period of rapid growth at the end of which the individual reaches physiological mat urity and is also \\nsexually mature. Differences in body composition, weight and height between sexes and between indivi duals of the \\nsame sex will bec ome apparent. Nutrient needs in this period are in accordance with the needs for growth. \\nPsychological and emotional factors may affect food intake in this age group. Peer pressure and lack  of awareness \\nregarding nutritional needs may lead to consumption o f nutritionally inadequate diet. Problems related to teenage \\nobesity, sports activity, marriage and diseases like diabetes may affect growth and nutritional stat us of the \\nadolescents. \\n\\uf0b7 During pregnancy, changes in both the mother and the fetus necessitate i ncreased intakes of nutrients needed for \\ngrowth. A pregnant woman should gain about 7 to 10 kg during the entire nine months. She should eat foods which \\nare rich in vitamins, minerals and proteins in addition to lots of carbohydrates and good fat. Malnu trition during \\npregnancy affects the developing baby. It may lead to a woman delivering prematurely or a low birth weight. \\nCurtailing dietary intake or unbalanced diets during pregnancy should be avoided. Fluid intake and c onsumption of \\nvegetables and fruits should be ample and normally salt should not be restricted. \\n\\uf0b7 We learnt about the nutritional needs of the elderly, and in doing so we have also focused on many o ther aspects \\nsuch as the definition of elderly, what is an ageing process and the impact of nutritional status on the health of older \\nadults. We studied about physiological changes in the body systems and based on these nutritional re quirements of \\nthe older adults. The guidelines for planning balanced nutrient dense diets for them were also outlined. \\n There are special considerations to be kept in mind while planning menus for them and these have been pointed out.\"),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"INTRODUCTION \\nNutrition is a basic human need and a prerequisite to a healthy life. A proper \\ndiet is essential from the very early stages of life for proper growth, development \\nand to remain active. Food consumption, which largely depends on production and \\ndistribution, determines the health and nutritional status of the population. The \\nrecommended dietary allowances (RDA) are nutrient-centred and  technical in \\nnature. Apart from supplying nutrients, foods provide a host of other components \\n(non-nutrient phytochemicals) which have a positive impact on health. Since \\npeople consume food, it is essential to advocate nutrition in terms of foods, rather \\nthan nutrients. Emphasis has, therefore, been shifted from a nutrient orientation to \\nthe food-based approach for attaining optimal nutritional status. Dietary guidelines \\nare a translation of scientific knowledge on nutrients into specific dietary advice. \\nThey represent the recommended dietary allowances of nutrients in terms of diets \\nthat should be consumed by the population. The guidelines promote the concept of \\nnutritionally adequate diets and healthy lifestyles from the time of conception to old \\nage. \\nFormulation of dietary goals and specific guidelines would help in providing \\nrequired guidance to people in ensuring nutritional adequacy. The dietary \\nguidelines could be directly applied for general population or specific physiological \\nor high risk groups to derive health benefits. They may also be used by medical and \\nhealth personnel, nutritionists and dietitians. The guidelines are consistent with the \\ngoals set in national policies on Agriculture, Health and Nutrition. \\nThe dietary guidelines ought to be practical, dynamic and flexible, based on the \\nprevailing situation. Their utility is influenced by the extent to which they reflect the \\nsocial,  economic, agricultural and other environmental conditions. The guidelines \\ncan be considered as an integral component of the country's comprehensive plan to \\nreach the goals specified in the National Nutrition Policy. \\nThe major food issues of concern are insufficient/ imbalanced intake of \\nfoods/nutrients. The common nutritional problems of public health importance in \\nIndia are low  birth weight, protein energy malnutrition in children, chronic energy \\ndeficiency in adults, micronutrient malnutrition and diet-related non- \\ncommunicable diseases. However, diseases at the either end of the spectrum of\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='malnutrition (under  and overnutrition) are important. Recent evidences \\nindicate that undernutrition in utero  may set the pace for diet-related  chronic \\ndiseases in later life. Population explosion, demographic changes, rapid \\nurbanization and alterations in traditional habits contribute to the development of \\ncertain unhealthy dietary practices and physical inactivity, resulting in diet-related \\nchronic diseases. \\nThe dietary guidelines emphasize promotion of health and prevention of \\ndisease, of all age groups with special focus on vulnerable segments of the \\npopulation such as infants, children and adolescents, pregnant and lactating \\nwomen and the elderly. Other related factors, which need consideration are \\nphysical activity, health care, safe water supply and socio-economic development, \\nall of which strongly influence nutrition and health. \\nIn this document, food-related approaches, both in qualitative and quantitative \\nterms, have been incorporated. Emphasis is on positive recommendations which \\ncan maximize protective effects through use of a variety of foods in tune with \\ntraditional habits.  The higher goals set with respect to certain food items such as \\npulses, milk and vegetables/fruits are intended to encourage appropriate policy \\ndecisions. Suitable messages for each of these guidelines have been highlighted. \\nA variety of foods, which are available and are within the reach of the common \\nman, can be selected to formulate nutritionally adequate diets. While there are only \\nfour accepted basic food groups, in India, there are a variety of food preparations \\nand culinary practices.  Different cereals/millets are used as staple food, apart from \\na variety of cereal/millet/pulse combinations in different regions of India. The \\ncooking oils and fat used are of several kinds.  The proposed guidelines help to \\nformulate health promoting recipes and diets which are region- and culture- \\nspecific. It is difficult to compute standard portion sizes, common to all regions of \\nIndia. Nevertheless, attempts are made to give portion sizes and exchanges.  \\nTranslation of knowledge into action calls for the coordinated efforts of several \\ngovernment and non-government organizations. The fifteen guidelines prescribed, \\nherein, stress on adequacy of intake of foods from all food groups for maintenance \\nof optimal health. Effective IEC strategies and other large-scale educational \\ncampaigns should be launched to encourage people to follow the dietary \\nguidelines. Such efforts should be integrated with the existing national nutrition \\nand health programs. \\nnutrition \\n2'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content=\"CURRENT DIET AND NUTRITION SCENARIO \\n     Health and nutrition are the most important contributory factors for human \\nresource development in the country.  India has been classified by the World Bank \\n1\\nas a country with a lower middle income, with per capita GNP of US $ 996-3945 . It \\nth \\nranks 160  in terms of human development among 209 countries. Among the Indian \\npopulation, about 28% in the rural and 26% in the urban areas are estimated to be \\n2\\nbelow the poverty line , which is defined as the expenditure needed to obtain, on an \\naverage, 2400 Kcal per capita per day in the rural areas and 2100 Kcal in urban \\nareas. Long-term malnutrition leads to stunting and wasting, non-communicable \\nchronic diet related disorders, increased morbidity and mortality and reduced \\nphysical work output. It is a great economic loss to the country and undermines \\ndevelopment. \\n     Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM), micronutrient deficiencies such as vitamin A \\ndeficiency (VAD) , Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA), Iodine Deficiency Disorders(IDD) \\nand vitamin B-complex deficiencies are the nutrition problems frequently \\nencountered, particularly among the rural poor and urban slum  communities. \\n     Undernutrition starts as early as during conception. Because of extensive \\nmaternal undernutrition (underweight, poor weight gain during pregnancy, \\nnutritional anaemia and vitamin deficiencies), about 22% of the infants are born with \\n3\\nlow birth-weight (<2500 g) , as compared to less than 10% in the developed \\ncountries. Both clinical and sub-clinical undernutrition are widely prevalent even \\nduring early childhood and adolescence. Though the prevalence of florid forms of \\nsevere PEM like kwashiorkor and marasmus among preschool children is <1 %, \\nnational surveys indicate that about half of (48%) <5 year children suffer from sub- \\nclinical undernutrition such as underweight (43%) stunting and wasting (20%) which \\n3\\nindicates that undernutrition is of long duration . The studies have shown that there \\nis a steep increase in the prevalence of underweight with increase of age, from 27% \\n4\\nat 6 months of age to a high of 45% at 24 months of age . This is attributable to faulty \\ninfant and young child feeding practices prevailing in the community. \\nPersistent undernutrition throughout the growing phase of childhood leads to \\nshort stature in adults.  About 33% of adult men and 36% of the women have a Body \\n2\\nMass Index (BMI) [Weight in kg/(Height in meter) ] below 18.5, which indicates \\n4\\nChronic Energy Deficiency or CED (Table1) . In the case of vitamin A deficiency, 0.8- \\n1% of preschool children show the signs of Bitot's spots and night blindness.  \\nVitamin A deficiency also increases the risk of disease and death. \\nCommon Nutrition Problems \\n3\"),\n",

Nearly three fourth (75%) of women in India are anemic, with the prevalence \\n5\\nof moderate to severe anemia being highest (50%) among pregnant women . It is \\n6\\nestimated that nutritional anemia contributes to about 24%  of maternal deaths \\nevery year and is one of the important causes of low birth weight.  It adversely affects \\nwork output among adults and learning ability in children. \\nIodine deficiency disorders (IDD) are very common among large sections of \\npopulation in several parts of the country.  About 167 million are estimated to be \\nliving in IDD endemic areas.  Iodine deficiency causes goiter (enlargement of thyroid \\ngland in the neck), neonatal hypothyroidism, cretinism among new borns, mental \\nretardation, delayed motor development, stunting, deaf-mutism and neuromuscular \\ndisorders. The most important consequence of iodine deficiency in mothers is \\ncretinism in which the children suffer from mental and growth retardation right from \\nthe birth. About 90,000 still-births and neonatal deaths occur every year due to \\nmaternal iodine deficiency.  Around 54 million persons are estimated to have goiter, \\n7\\n2.2 million have cretinism and 6.6 million suffer from mild psycho-motor handicaps . \\nIndia is passing through the phase of economic transition and while the problem \\nof undernutrition continues to be a major problem, prevalence of overnutrition is \\nemerging as a significant problem, especially in the urban areas. The prevalence of \\noverweight/ obesity is higher among the women (10.9%) compared to men (7.8%) in \\n4 8 \\nrural areas . The prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus  and Coronary Heart Disease \\n9\\n(CHD)  is also higher in urban areas as compared to their rural counterparts. The \\nincidence rate of cancer is comparatively higher among women (123) compared to \\n10 \\nmen (113 for 100,000) . \\nThe overall production of food grains (cereals/millets/pulses) recorded a \\nsignificant increase from about 108 million tones in 1970-71 to a little over 230 million \\n11,12 \\ntones during 2007-2008 . Though the production of cereals and millets appears to \\nbe adequate, production of pulses, the source of protein for the rural poor, actually \\nshows a decline.  Total Production of vegetables is about 30% less than the demand \\n13 \\nof 100 million tones . The total production of milk during 2006-2007 was about 100.9 \\nmillion tones,  corresponding to about 245 g per caput per day, which is lower than \\n14 \\nthe world average of 285 g per day . Though the per capita availability of various \\nfoods stuffs is comparable to RDA, the distribution of foods, both within the \\ncommunity and the family, may be unfavorable to some vulnerable groups due to low \\nincome and purchasing power.  In view of the high cost of milk, a large proportion of \\nthe Indian population subsists on diets consisting mostly of plant foods with low \\nnutrient bio-availability (Table 2). \\nFood availability and consumption \\n5'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='On the other side of the spectrum of malnutrition, diet-related non-communi- \\ncable diseases are commonly seen. With increasing urbanization, energy-rich diets \\ncontaining higher amount of fat and sugar, which also provide less dietary fibre and \\ncomplex carbohydrates, are being frequently consumed, particularly by high- \\nincome groups.  In addition, the urban population is turning to be more sedentary \\nwith little physical activity. Consumption of alcohol, providing empty calories, and \\ntobacco use is also common among them. Hence, prevalence of disorders like \\nobesity, heart disease, hypertension (high blood pressure) diabetes and certain \\ntypes of cancers is on the increase. \\nWidespread malnutrition is largely a result of dietary inadequacy and \\nunhealthy lifestyles. Other contributing factors are poor purchasing power, faulty \\nfeeding habits, large family size, frequent infections, poor health care, inadequate \\nsanitation and low agricultural production.

During the second year, the child increases not only in height by 7-8 cm but \\nalso gains 4 times of its birth weight. During the pre-adolescent period the child \\ngrows, on an average, 6-7 cm in height and 1.5 to 3 kg in weight every year and \\nsimultaneously development and maturation of various tissues and organs take \\nplace (Table 5). \\nAdolescent period (teenage) is spread almost over \\na decade. It is characterized by rapid increase in height \\nand weight, hormonal changes, sexual maturation and \\nwide swings in emotion. Adolescent growth spurt starts \\nat about 10-12 years in girls and two years later in boys. \\nThe annual peak rates for height and weight are 9-10 \\ncm and 8-10 kg.

Adolescent girls are at greater physiological stress \\nthan boys because of menstruation. Their nutritional needs are of particular \\nimportance as they have to prepare for motherhood.

The child requires prompt correction of fluid and electrolyte loss \\nusing oral rehydration solution (ORS) along with appropriate/adequate feeding. \\nORS can be prepared by adding a pinch of salt (between thumb and index finger) \\nand a teaspoon of sugar to a glass of potable water. Home-made fluids such as rice \\nkanji  or buttermilk with salt can also be used. During infections, children should \\nfrequently be given small quantities of fluids by mouth, including plain water.  During \\ndiarrhea, feeding should be continued, though this goes against the popular \\npractice. Breast-milk promotes sodium and water transport across the gut and, thus, \\nprevents dehydration and weight loss, in addition to providing other nutrients.  \\nThe diet of 1-2 year old children with diarrhea should provide energy of about \\n1000 Kcal/day. Calorie-rich, semi-solid, soft diets may be prepared from a variety of \\ncereals and pulses. Sprouted grains are easily digestible and provide good nutrition. \\nFat and sugar help in reducing the bulk of the diets and make them energy dense. \\nMilk may be mixed with cereal diet to avoid lactose malabsorption. If milk is not \\ntolerated, it may be replaced by an equal volume of curd/yogurt/soymilk. Mashed \\nvegetables may be incorporated in the diet. Feeding becomes easier after the \\ninfection subsides. About 6-8 feeds should be given during the day so that the extra \\nfood (120-140 Kcal/kg) may be consumed by the child without any difficulty. \\nDeficiency of the enzyme lactase leads to lactose intolerance. During acute or \\nchronic diarrhea, lactose intolerance is a mild and transient problem. This problem \\ncan be overcome by reducing the quantity of milk taken at a time or taking milk along \\nwith a cereal-pulse meal. There is no need to stop milk in acute diarrhoea. In chronic \\ndiarrhea, some children may develop lactose intolerance. In such children, milk may \\nbe stopped temporarily. A diet based on cereals and pulses or chicken and egg white \\nallows the gut to recover and milk can then be slowly introduced.

Apart from being non- \\nnutritious, processed foods also contain food additives. Food additives consumed \\nbeyond permissible limits may have adverse effects on health. The national food \\nregulatory authorities periodically review these limits. Thus, consumption of \\nprocessed foods may not only affect intake of nutrients, but in addition, increase the \\nrisk of exposure to various chemical additives. \\nIn the coming years, with larger constraints on time at home, demand for \\nprocessed foods is certain to increase. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that \\nintake of a nutritionally balanced diet is not compromised with unwise intake of \\nvarious processed and convenience foods. Processed vegetables and fruits \\navailable in the market are no match to nutrient rich fresh vegetables and fruits. \\nSugars occur both naturally and as an ingredient in many foods. They are present \\nin natural foods like fruits, vegetables, milk and honey. Added sugars provide taste \\nand texture to foods. Sugar is present in processed foods like chocolates, jams, ice- \\ncreams and soft drinks. The most familiar sugar is sucrose. Refined or table sugar \\n(sucrose) provides “empty calories”. Foods such as cakes, pastries, confectionery \\nand sweets often have high amounts of fat, and sugar, and are prepared with refined \\ncereals. Excess consumption of sugary foods may lead to obesity and elevated \\nblood lipids. Children overindulging in chocolates and candies are prone to dental \\ncarries. For prevention of diet-related chronic diseases, sugars and refined cereals \\nshould be sparingly used. \\nWhy should we restrict intake of unhealthy processed foods? \\nWhy should we moderate intake of sugar ?'),\n",

In India, the \\nelderly constitute about 7 percent of the total population (Census, 2001) and by 2016 \\nand by they are likely to increase to 10 percent.  \\nAgeing affects almost all the systems of the body, and is associated \\nwith several physiological, metabolic and psychological changes. The \\nchanges incude decline in physical activity, digestion, metabolism, bone \\nmass and muscle mass. Failing eye-sight and impaired hearing may also \\noccur. Low appetite as a result of loss of taste and smell perception, \\ndental problems, atrophic changes in GIT, constipation and decreased \\nphysical activity could lead to overall decrease of food intake and poor \\nabsorption of nutrients. Inability to prepare food, economic dependency \\nand other psycho-social problems adversely affects the health and \\nnutritional status of the elderly. \\nThere is a decline in immune function with advancing age, which leads to \\ndecreased resistance to infectious diseases.

Similarly, elderly individuals are at increased risk of osteomalacia i.e. \\ndefective bone mineralization due to lack of exposure to sunlight and poor diet. \\nIn general, majority of the health problems among the elderly are nutrition related. \\nConsumption of nutritious foods rich in micronutrients including antioxidant vitamins \\n& minerals and fibre, comfortable level of physical activity would enable the elderly to \\nlive active and meaningful healthy lives, without being a burden on society and their \\nfamily members. Uncomplicated ageing can also be quite productive, say in the \\ndomestic sphere. \\nResistance to disease declines in the elderly. The common ailments in the elderly \\nare degenerative diseases such as arthritis (joint diseases), osteoporosis, \\nosteomalacia, cataract, diabetes, cardiovascular (stroke, heart diseases) problems, \\nneurological (Parkinson's, Alzheimer's) and psychiatric (dementia, depression, \\ndelirium) disorders and cancer.  Besides these, the prevalence of respiratory, gastro \\nintestinal tract (GIT) and urinary tract infections is common among the elderly. \\nAs people grow older, they tend to become physiologically less active and \\ntherefore need fewer calories to maintain their weights. The daily intake of oil should \\nnot exceed 20 g. Use of ghee, butter, vanaspati  and coconut oil should be avoided. \\nThey need foods rich in protein such as pulses, toned milk, egg-white etc. The \\nelderly population is prone to various nutritional deficiencies. Therefore, the elderly \\nneed nutrient-rich foods rich in calcium, micro-nutrients and fibre. Apart from cereals \\nand pulses, they need daily at least 200-300 ml of milk and milk products and 400 g \\nof vegetables and fruits to provide fibre, micro-nutrients and antioxidants. Inclusion \\nof these items in the diet improves the quality of the diet and bowel function. Flesh \\nfoods and eggs add to the quality of diet (annexure 14 & 15 ). \\nThe diet needs to be well cooked, soft and less salty and spicy. Small quantities of \\nfood should be consumed at more frequent intervals and adequate water should be \\nconsumed to avoid dehydration, hyponatraemia and constipation. \\nExercise is an integral part of maintaining healthy life. It helps to regulate body \\nweight. The risk of degenerative diseases is considerably decreased by regular \\nexercise.

About 75-80% of pesticide residues are removed by cold water washing. \\nWashing with 2% of salt water will remove most of the contact pesticide residues that \\nnormally appear on the surface of the vegetables and fruits.  \\nThe pesticide residues that are on the surface of the grapes, apples, guava, \\nplums, mangoes, peaches, pears etc, vegetables like tomatoes, brinjal, okra require \\n2-3 washings. The green leafy vegetables must be washed with 2% salt water. The \\npesticide residues from green leafy vegetables is removed satisfactorily by normal \\nprocessing such as washing, blanching and cooking. \\nBlanching \\nBlanching is a short treatment in hot water or steam applied to most of the \\nvegetables. Certain pesticide residues can effectively be removed by blanching.  \\nBut before blanching it is very important to thoroughly pre-wash the vegetables and \\nfruits.  \\nPeeling \\nContact pesticides that appear on the surface of the fruits and vegetables can be \\nremoved by peeling. Steps such as concentration, dehydration, and extraction from \\nthe raw product can further reduce pesticide residues in the end produce. The net \\ninfluence of processing almost always results in minimal residues in processed \\nfood. \\nAnnexure - 12'),\n",

Define Food, Nutrition & Health \\n2. Explain the interrelationship in maintaining good health & wellbeing. \\n3. List the parameters for maintaining Primary Health Care. \\n \\n \\n \\nWe all know that food is a basic necessity.This unit tells you about food and some of its components.  \\nYou will also be introduced to the terms nutrition and health.Food is any substance consumed to provide \\nnutritional support for an organism. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, \\nsuch as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. \\n \\nFoods are made up mostly of bio- chemicals which are mainly derived from living sources such as plants \\nand animals. There are three main groups of constituents in foods: Carbohydrates, Protein and Fats and \\nderivatives of these\\n. The essential substances contributed by our food are called nutrients. If these \\nnutrients are not present in our food in sufficient amounts, the result is ill health and in some cases, \\neven death. Food also contains many substances, which are non -nutrients e.g. colouring, and flavouring \\nsubstances in food. Food is therefore, a complex mixture o different nutrients and non-nutrients. \\nFUNCTIONS OF FOOD: Food consists in part of various nutrients. These nutrients can be classified into \\nfive major categories (based on certain similar features): proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitami ns and \\nminerals.Food also has social and psychological functions in addition to physiological ones. \\nPhysiological Functions: The physiological functions performed by food are the energy -giving, body -\\nbuilding, protective and regulatory functions. The energy -giving function of food is basically performed \\nby two nutrient categories-carbohydrates and fats. This is why these nutrients are also referred to as the \\n“body fuels”.Food is also needed for growth and repair. For both growth and repair, proteins are \\nnecessary.The other major physiological functions performed by food are the protective and regulatory \\nfunctions. Let us talk about the meaning of the term ‘protective’ first. Here protective refers to the role \\nin preventing infection by ensuring proper functio ning of the body systems responsible for fighting \\ninfections. \\nThe regulatory function mentioned earlier refers to the role of food in controlling body processes. \\nSeveral processes take place in the body such as the beating of the heart, maintenance of body  \\ntemperature and contraction of muscles. Each of these processes is controlled. This is achieved by \\ncertain specific nutrients and is illustrative of their regulatory function. Vitamins, minerals, and proteins \\ncontribute substantially to both protective and regulatory functions. So does water. \\nSocial Functions: Food and eating has significant social meaning. Sharing food with any other person \\nimplies social acceptance. When you share a meal with anyone else, you are expressing your acceptance \\nof friendship and respect for that person. Food is an integral part of festivity anywhere in the world. \\nStudy Material'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='Joyous occasions such as birth of a child or a marriage are celebrated by having feasts and serving \\ndelicacies. \\nFood also has a specific significance and meaning in t he religious context. Certain food items such as \\nfruits, sweets and coconuts are  offered to the deity in temples. Often sweets are prepared at temples \\nand gurudwaras and distributed to devotees as a benediction or Prasad. Food thus becomes an integral \\npart of the social and religious life of people. \\nPsychological Function: We all have emotional needs such as the need for security, love and attention. \\nFood is one way through which these needs are satisfied. Food is also closely allied to our emotions. \\nFood often serves as a reward. On the other hand, certain foods become associated with sickness such \\nas khichri (a rice-dhal porridge). This type of food is generally eaten when a person suffers from fever \\nand may, therefore, not be associated with pleasant feelings. \\nNutrition: Nutrition is a scientific discipline with food as the major focus of interest. It can be defined as” \\nThe science of foods, the nutrients and other substances therein, their action, interaction  and balance \\nin relationship to health and di seases; the process by which the organism ingests, digests, absorb, \\ntransports and utilizes nutrients and disposes of their wend products.” \\nThe body needs each nutrient in specific amounts. Some are needed in relatively larger amounts -the \\nmacronutrients, and some in smaller amounts -the micronutrients. Each nutrient plays a significant role \\nin the body and a balance should be maintained. The term balance means that the nutrients needed by \\nthe body should be provided in the right amount and proportions. \\nNutrients are the constituents in food \\nthat must be supplied to the body in suitable amounts. These include carbohydrates, fats, proteins, \\nminerals, vitamins and water. Chemical substances obtained from food and used in the body to provide \\nenergy, structural materials and regulating agents to support growth, maintenance and repair of body’s \\ntissues. Nutrients may also reduce the risks of some degenerative diseases. \\nLet’s study different aspects of nutrition. \\n1. Social and cultural aspects of eating:  Food has a special meaning in the social and cultural \\ncontext. Our ancient vedic tradition emphasizes food as the life-giver. It further attributes \\nspecific qualities to specific foods. It is important to keep a person’s socio -cultural background in \\nmind whenever we talk of improving or modifying food related practices. \\n2. The psychology of eating: The individual reactions to food and to the people around us can have \\na significant psychological influence on our eating pattern.Many factors influences our choic es \\nof foods such as advertisements and the attitude of other people around us. \\n3. The economics of food: Food costs money. It must be within the reach of people and it must be \\nequitably distributed to all sections of the populations. The availability of food and its proper \\ndistribution is of great importance. It is the coordinated effort of planners, farmers, suppliers \\nand consumers of food products to ensure equitable distribution of food products. \\n \\n \\n \\nStudy Material'),\n",

Health is a positive state of complete \\nwellbeing and not just absence of disease. One dimension, which is  also gaining prominence, is spiritual \\nhealth. Let us now examine each of these dimensions of health.  \\n1. Physical health: The physical dimension of health is familiar to us. Physical heal is easy to detect \\nand describe. A person is physically healthy if he or she looks alert, is responsive, energetic and \\nvigorous. \\n2. Mental health: Mental health is a more complex concept than physical health. It implies freedom \\nfrom internal conflicts and a good capacity to adjust to situations and people. Physical and mental \\nhealth are inter -related. Physical ill health can lead to mental ill health. The reverse can also \\nhappen. \\n3. Social health: An individual who recognizes his/her obligations towards other members of society \\nand is able to relate to other people around him/her can be described as socially healthy. It is \\nimpossible to realize the goal of social health if mental health has not been achieved. Similarly, a \\nperson who does not enjoy physical health would find it difficult to achieve social health. \\n4. Spiritual health: Spiritual health is the most difficult to define. The concept of doing good and not of \\nnot harming there: of believing in the basic forces of goodness and justice whether or not these are \\nworshipped as God: of recognizing the needs of other and trying to fulf il them: of commitment, duty \\nand obligation, these are all characteristics of a spiritually well person. \\n \\nPrimary Health care \\nPrimary health care is a whole-of-society approach to health and well-being centred on the needs and \\npreferences of individuals, families and communities.  It addresses the broader determinants of health and \\nfocuses on the comprehensive and interrelated aspects of physical, mental and social health and wellbeing.  \\nCARBOHYDRATES FATS PROTEINS MINERALS & VITAMINS \\nMajor energy giving foods \\nthat includes sugar, \\nstarches and fibres. \\n \\n \\nA group of fatty substances \\nincluding triglycerides and \\ncholesterol that are not \\nsoluble in water. \\n \\n \\nMajor structural part of body’s \\ncells composed of nitrogen-\\ncontaining amino acids, \\nparticularly rich in animal foods. \\n \\n \\nNoncaloric, inorganic nutrients \\nfound in a wide variety of foods. \\n \\n \\nStudy Material'),\n",

Cereals and millets are the major source of carbohydrates in \\nIndian diets. All cereals like wheat, rice and millets contain considerable amount of starch. \\n• Functions: Some of the important functions of carbohydrates are energy -giving, protein- sparing \\naction and utilization of fats.though proteins can be broken down in the ody to meet the energy \\nneed,but an insufficient amount of carbohydrates in the diet will f orce the body to break down \\nproteins for releasing energy. Some amount of carbohydrate is needed for the proper utilization of \\nfat in the body. \\n \\nProteins: \\nProtein is the most abundant component in the human body. It is made up of compounds called amino \\nacids, which are also referred to as the building block of proteins. The linkage of individual amino acids \\ntogether in long chains forms proteins . The quality of food protein depends on the proportion of essential \\nand non-essential amino acids. Those amino ac ids which cannot be manufacture by the body are called \\nessential amino acids and those which can be manufacture by the body are called non- essential amino \\nacids. Proteins can be divided into essential and non- essential .Proteins are essential to all life. In animals, \\nthey help form supporting and protective structures such as cartilage, skin, nails, hair and muscle.

It is always a big challenge to provide a good nutritious diet for each of the member, \\nparticularly when their needs, preferences vary.  So what should be the guiding factor to ensure \\nbalanced meals that meet the needs of all members? Is there a Standard or a Reference that \\nwould serve as a goal for Good Nutrition? This section focuses on this important concept of \\nRecommended Dietary Allowances. \\nRECOMMENDED DIETARY ALLOWANCES: BASIC CONCEPT \\nHumans need  a wide range of nutrients to lead a healthy and active life. The amount of each \\nnutrient needed for an individual depends on age, body weight, physical activity, physiological \\nstate (pregnancy, lactation) etc.  So basically the requirement for nutrients varies from individual \\nto individual.  So, what do we mean by the term \"Nutrient Requirement\" here? \\n The requirement for a particular nutrient is the minimum amount that needs to be consumed to \\nprevent symptoms of deficiency and to maintain satisfactory level of the nutrient in the body.  \\nFor example in case of infants and children, the requirement may be equated with the amount \\nthat will maintain a satisfactory rate of growth and development. Similarly for an adult the \\nnutrient requirement is the amount that will maintain body weight and prevent the depletion of \\nthe nutrient from the body which otherwise may lead to deficiency.  In physiological condition \\nlike pregnancy and lactation, adult women may need additional nutrients to meet the demand of \\nfetal growth along with their own nutrient needs. \\nNow within each group (say infants or an adults etc)  there may  \\nbe individual variations in the nutrient requirements.  For instance,  \\nthere may be a period of low intake or the quality of the diet may  \\nvary,  similarly the effect of cooking and processing may be different \\n and  bioavailability of the nutrient from the diet may also vary.   \\n \\nSo how do we account for this? Well a safety factor is added over and above the nutrient \\nrequirement for each group to arrive at the Recommended Dietary Allowances. \\nBioavailability refers to the \\nrelease of nutrient from the \\nfood, its absorption in the \\nintestine and bio-response \\nStudy Material'),\n",

RDA takes into \\naccount the variability that exists in the requirement of a given nutrient between individuals in a \\ngiven population group. So RDA is neither minimal requirement nor necessarily optimal level of \\nintake. Rather, RDA is the safe and adequate level, which incorporates margin of safety intended \\nto be sufficiently generous (high enough) to encompass the presumed variability in requirements \\namong individuals and  meet the needs of almost all healthy people.  \\nFurther please note, RDA's do not apply to people who are suffering from disease which \\ninfluence the nutrient intake. They only apply to healthy people. \\nNext we shall review the significance, uses of RDA's.   \\nSIGNIFICANCE/USES OF RDA \\n RDA, we know, represents the level of the nutrient to be consumed daily to meet all the \\nrequirements of most of the individuals in a given population. So RDA's help us plan balanced \\ndiets which include a variety of foods derived from diverse food groups which help meet the \\nnutrient requirements. Other than this basic use, RDA's have come to serve many important \\npurposes. The various applications of RDA include: \\n• Comparison of individual intakes to the RDA allows an estimate to be made about the \\nprobable risk of deficiency among individuals, \\n• Modifying nutrient requirements in clinical management of diseases, \\n• To help public health nutritionists to compose diets for schools, hospitals, prisons etc.  \\n• For health care policy makers and public health nutritionists to design, develop nutrition \\nintervention programmes and policies, \\n• For planning and procuring food supplies for population groups, \\n• For evaluating the adequacy of food supplies in meeting  national nutritional needs, \\n• For interpreting food consumption records of individuals and populations, \\n• For establishing Standards for the national feeding programmes implemented by the \\nGovernments for its vulnerable population, \\n• For designing nutrition education programmes for the masses, \\n \\nREQUIREMENT  + SAFETY MARGIN   = RECOMMENDED DIETARY INTAKE \\n \\nStudy Material\"),\n",

Note, the RDA for Indians are presented for the different age categories: 0-6 months, 7 to \\n12 months, 1 – 3 years, 4 – 6 years, 7 – 9 years, 10 – 12 years, 13 – 15 years,16 – 18 \\nyears, adult man and women..   \\n2. Recommendations are given for energy and all other nutrients including proteins, visible \\nfat, calcium, iron, retinol, Beta Carotene, thiamine, riboflavin etc.  \\n3. Recommended dietary allowances for adults are based on sex (male, female), body \\nweight and physical activity level (i.e. Sedentary, Moderate and Heavy work) . \\n4. RDA for energy is expressed in kilocalories (Kcal), for proteins, fats in grams (g), and for \\ncalcium, iron, vitamins and minerals in milligram (mg) or microgram.  \\n5. RDA for protein is based on body weight. The relationship can be expressed as 1g protein \\nper kg body weight in the case of adults. It varies for other age categories. \\n6. RDA for energy and protein are given as additional intakes in pregnancy and lactation, \\nindicated by a ( \" + \" sign). This requirement is over and above the normal requirement of \\nadult women. RDA for other nutrients are given as total intake figures. \\n7. In infancy RDA\\'s for energy, protein, iron, thiamin, riboflavin and niacin are expressed as \\nper kg body weight (expected for a healthy, normal growing infant of a particular age) \\n8. RDA for Vitamin A have been given in terms of retinol or alternatively in terms of Beta \\nCarotene. \\n \\nStudy Material'),\n",

Define the terms meal planning, balanced diet and explain the concept of meal planning  \\n2. Illustrate the factors affecting meal planning. \\n3. Apply guidelines in planning balanced diet \\n \\nIn this unit we will study about what to eat each day at each meal. You will learn to apply \\nbasic knowledge of food and nutrition that you have already acquired earlier. Good health \\nand well being of a family is relat ed to the sensible selection of food items in the daily diet. \\nLet us now learn how to plan a healthy, joyful and satisfying meal for the family by \\nunderstanding the basic concepts of meal planning.  \\nWHAT IS MEAL PLANNING \\n \\n          You may have heard in you r home from your mother that planning for meals saves time and \\nmoney. Now you will  understand the concept of  planning a balanced diet  to plan a nutritious \\ndiet for your family.  \\nConcept of meal planning -Meal planning involves planning nutritious meals for all individuals \\nin a family keeping in mind their age, activity, likes, dislikes and food availability. It also involves \\nplanning of balanced meals which are colorful, attractive, appetizing, and palatab le and within \\nthe economic means of the individuals concerned. It further involves decision making regarding \\nwhat to eat and how much to eat each day at each meal. The meals planned should not only \\nensure that nutrient requirements are adequately met but a lso be flexible enough to take \\nadvantage of easy availability and lower prices of seasonal foods and meet the needs and \\nchoices of the family members.  \\nAs the health of an individual or a family depends on how well they are fed within the given \\nresources, effective meal planning is a great challenge to every meal manager, and if done well \\nis a satisfying and rewarding experience. \\nImportance of meal planning \\n         Meal planning helps to: - \\n• Retain, enhance nutrients and minimize nutrient loss -Meal planning is done in a way that the \\nmeals are prepared and served at fixed meal times without too much holding or reheating which \\nhelps to retain the nutrients.  \\n• Introduce variety and avoid monotony -Variety can be introduced by using different ingredients \\nchosen fr om different food groups, using various textures, cooking methods, spices and \\ncondiments, etc. \\nStudy Material'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='• Make the food attractive and appetizing -Garnishes and using combination of contrasting colored \\nfoods are some of the ways meals can be made attractive and appetizing. \\n \\n• Save time, energy and fuel -Planning meals in advance helps to save time, energy and fuel as all \\nthe ingredients can be collected together from the store.  For example, potatoes for dosa  and \\nsamosas can be boiled, peeled and cut together, if meals are planned. \\n \\n• Plan low cost n utritious meals within the resources-Careful planning can help save money by \\nbuying seasonal foods and cheaper substitutes that have same nutritive value. \\n \\n \\n• Meet the individual nutritional requirements -Meal planning can help meet  the individual needs \\nof all the family members, the same common meal can be modified to suit any member suffering \\nfrom an ailment. \\n \\n• Reuse the left over  in a  novel way -Careful planning can ensure no food is left over. Also, any \\nleftover can be incorporated  in the next meal in an interesting manner, without compromising on \\nthe quality. For example, left over rice can be used to make rice pudding, cutlets, lemon rice, etc. \\n       FACTORS AFFECTING MEAL PLANNING  \\nGood meal planning is both a science and an art.  Science shows us the way to include nutritious foods \\ninto diet, while art is involved  in converting raw food  item into meals that are attractive, delicious and \\nsatisfying in all ways. \\n \\n        Following are the factors which should be kept in mind when planning meals for a family- \\n \\n1. Nutritional Needs- When planning a meal the major factor to keep in mind is that the meal \\nmust fulfill the nutritional requirements of family members.   \\n \\n2. Economic factors- The purchase of food items and their quantity depends on the total income of \\na family. \\n \\n3. Size and composition of the family \\n \\n(i) Size of the family- Size of a family refers to the total number of its members. The   structure \\nof the family whether nuclear or joint also affects the meal planning. \\n \\n (ii) Family composition-Family composition refers to the age, gender , activity, occupation, and \\ndifferent physical conditions of its members. \\n \\n4. Season- Meals should be in accordance to the season. With the  change in season, availabi lity of \\nfoodstuffs and our taste also change. In summers, bottle gour d, ridge gourd, pumpkin, bitter \\ngourd, etc. are available in abundance while carrots, radish, peas, cauliflower, etc. in winters.  \\nStudy Material'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='5.  Food availability- Availability of food also affects the meal planning. A housewife should make \\nmaximum use of locally produced foo dstuffs because they are cheap and tasty. For example, \\npeople living in coastal areas consumes more seafood as it is easily available and cheap Including \\nmango or watermelon in diet is of no use in winter if it is not available.  \\n \\n6.  Food acceptance- Acceptance or rejection of food by a person is affected by his likes and \\ndislikes, reli gious and social traditions and customs. All these factors are to be kept in mind \\nwhile planning a meal.  \\n \\n7. Availability of time, energy and labor saving devices- Meal planning is greatly affected by \\navailability of time, energy and labor saving devices with the housewife. This is important in \\nthose cases where the housewife is also working.  \\n8. Occasion- Different occasions such as birthday, anniversary and festivities may have special \\nmenu to celebrate the importance of the occasion. \\n9. Appearance of food \\n• Color should be attractive. Avoid a menu of all white, yellow or greens colored food. Example-\\nyellow dal with pumpkin vegetable. \\n• Include contrasting textures like soft foods and crisp food. \\n• Bland and spicy flavors both should be combined. \\n• Different shapes may be used like round, flat, shredded, sliced or diced, cubes, etc. \\n \\nBALANCED DIET\\n \\nIn the previous chapter you have already studied about five food groups. Now will learn to  incorporate \\nvarious food groups in terms of nutritional quality and quantity in p lanning a balanced diet for a person. \\nLet us now understand and define a balanced diet. \\n Balanced diet- A balanced diet is one which provides all the nutrients in required amounts and proper \\nproportions. It can easily be achieved through a blend of the fiv e basic food groups. The quantities of \\nfoods needed to meet the nutrient requirements vary with age, gender, physiological status and physical \\nactivity.  \\nBalanced diet also has a provision for extra nutrients which can be reserved in the body to enable it to \\nwithstand short periods of low dietary intake. Hence it is very important to judiciously choose and \\ncombine variety of food stuffs from each food group. \\n \\n \\nStudy Material'),\n",

As you all know that we need food to sustain life and health. However, \\nnutritional needs vary from one life stage to another. During intrauteri ne development, \\ninfancy, and childhood, for example, recommended intakes of macronutrients and most \\nmicronutrients are higher relative to body size, compared with those during adulthood. You \\nwill be surprised to know that young children require a higher energy compared to body size \\nto help physical and mental development. On the other hand, inactive senior citizens need \\nlower energy than other adults to maintain their weight and stay healthy.                     \\n         \\nNUTRITION DURING INFANCY (0-1 YEARS)   \\n \\n          Infancy is called as earliest part of childhood. During the first year of life, good nutrition is \\nessential to healthy growth and development. It is the period from birth to one year of age. \\nInfancy is characterized by rapid physical and soci al growth and development; many changes \\noccur that affect feeding and nutrient intake.  Infants are entirely dependent on their parents or \\ncaregivers for providing them with nourishment. The first year of life is also a time of great \\nnutritional change for the child, from a diet consisting entirely of milk to one consisting of a \\nvariety of foods. Optimal nutrition has a greater importance during this time of life than during \\nany other because of its effect on brain growth, the development of the nervous system, overall \\ngrowth and development, and future health. According to World Health Organization (WHO) \\nfigures the average weight of the healthy new born is around 3.2 kg. A healthy baby doubles \\nhis birth weight by six months and becomes three times by one ye ar of age. The normal birth \\nlength of 50-55cm also increases by another 23-25cm during the first year. \\n         NUTRIENT NEEDS OF INFANTS \\nEstimates of energy and nutrient needs in infancy are summarized in the Table - . .

Childhood is the time for children to be in school and at play, to grow strong and \\nconfident with the love and encouragement of their family and an ext ended community of caring adults. \\nEating a balanced diet and regular exercise is essential for all individuals, but particularly for school -aged \\nchildren. Poor nutrition compromises both the quality of life of school -aged children but also their potential \\nto benefit from education. Good nutrition of school aged children will also make sure they grow to their full \\npotential, and provide the stepping stones to a healthy life. The best nutritional advice to keep children \\nhealthy includes encouraging them to eat breakfast every day. \\nThe World Health Organization  (WHO) defines an adolescent as any person between ages 10 and 19. \\nAdolescents also undergo a very rapid growth during their puberty (called the  pubertal growth spurt ). The \\nnutritional requirements of young people are influenced primarily by the spurt of growth that occurs at \\npuberty. The peak of growth is generally between 11 and 15 years for girls and 13 and 16 years for boys.  The \\nnutrient needs of individual teenagers differ greatly, and food intake can vary enormously from day to day, \\nso that those with deficient or excessive intakes on one day may well compensate on the next. In this period \\nof life, several nutrients are at greater deficiency risk including iron and calcium. \\nIron \\nAmong adolescents, iron-deficiency anaemia is one of the most common diet -related deficiency diseases. \\nAdolescents are particularly susceptible to iron deficiency anaemia in view of their increased blood volume \\nand muscle mass during growth and development. This raises the need of iron for building up haemoglobin, \\nthe red pigment in blood that carries oxygen, and for the related protein myoglobin, in muscle. The increase \\nin lean body mass (LBM), composed mainly of muscle, is more important in adolescent boys than in girls. In \\npreadolescent years, LBM is about the same for both sexes. Once adolescence starts, however, the boy \\nundergoes a more rapid accumulation of LBM for ea ch additional kilogram of body weight gained during \\ngrowth, ending up with a final LBM maximum value double that of the girl. Other factors contributing to \\nelevated iron needs are increased body weight and the beginning of menstruation for girls. All these  factors \\nshould be taken into account when assessing iron needs in this group of age. \\n \\n \\nLearning Objectives: \\nAfter reading this unit, the students will be able to:  \\n1. Learn nutritional needs in children and adolescents. \\n2. Plan a balanced diet for children and adolescents.  \\n3. Plan a nutritious lunch box for children.  \\n4. Illustrate factors affecting food and nutrients intake.  \\n \\nStudy Material'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='One of the most important diet considerations during adolescence is an increase in the intake of iron -rich \\nfoods such as lean meats and fish as well as beans, dark gr een vegetables, nuts and iron -fortified cereals and \\nother grains. Iron from animal foods (known as haem iron) is much better absorbed than iron from non-\\nanimal sources (non-haem iron). Adolescents following vegetarian diets are therefore at an increased ri sk of \\niron-deficiency. However, vitamin C (e.g. from citrus fruits) and animal proteins (meat & fish) assist in the \\nabsorption of non-haem iron. \\nCalcium \\n \\nThe skeleton accounts for at least 99% of the body stores of calcium and the gain in skeletal weight i s most \\nrapid during the adolescent growth spurt. About 45% of the adult skeletal mass is formed during \\nadolescence, although its growth continues well beyond the adolescent period and into the third decade. All \\nthe calcium for the growth of the skeleton mu st be derived from the diet. The largest gains are made in early \\nadolescence, between about 10-14 years in girls and 12-16 years in boys. \\nDuring peak adolescent growth, calcium retention is, on average, about 200mg/day in girls and 300 mg/day \\nin boys. The efficiency of calcium absorption is only around 30% so it is important that the diet supplies an \\nadequate calcium intake to help build the densest bones possible. The achievement of peak bone mass during \\nchildhood and adolescence is crucial to reduce the r isk of osteoporosis in later years. By eating several \\nservings of dairy products, such as milk, curd and cheese, the recommended calcium intake can be achieved. \\nAs well as a good dietary supply of calcium, other vitamins or minerals, like vitamin D and phosphorous, are \\nneeded for building up bones. Physical activity is also essential, particularly weight-bearing exercise, which \\nprovides the stimulus to build and retain bone in the body. Activities such as cycling, gymnastics, skating, \\nball games, dancing and supervised weight training for at least 30-60 minutes a day, three to five times a \\nweek can help build bone mass and density. Making the right dietary and lifestyle choices early in life will \\nhelp young people develop health-promoting behaviors that they can follow throughout life. \\n \\nImportance of breakfast \\nBreakfast is important particularly for a school child. It breaks the fast to the sleep hours and prepares a child for \\nproblem solving and memory spans in the learning period at school. Children who ski p breakfast do not make up \\nnutrient and energy deficits later in the day and tend to perform more poorly on tests of cognition than those who \\neat breakfast. It is not enough for children to have just a glass of milk. An ideal breakfast should have at least  3-5 \\nfoods from the basic five food groups.  \\n \\nPacked lunches - The packed lunch is a lunch that is packed in a Tiffin box to be eaten by the child while in \\nschool. Packed lunches have become a necessity for school going children. Taking lunch from home needs little \\nefforts, but helps in maintaining good health. Carrying food from home is less expensive more convenient more \\nhygienic and meets the individual requirements.  \\n \\nSuggested packed lunches- \\n \\n• Vegetable stuffed parantha and curd  \\n• Chapatti, dal and salad \\nStudy Material'),\n",

Or combination of \\nvegetable proteins cereals and pulses can be given for better utilization. \\n• Repetitiveness should be avoided in packed lunches. There should be variety. \\n• It is sensible to have a different food in packed lunch than what one had for breakfast. \\n• The food should have the correct consistency. Too watery things may leak and too dry food may not be \\nappetizing to the child.  \\n• Containers should be cleaned and dried before packing the food. \\n• Involve the child in planning, preparing or packing the lunch box. \\n• Make the lunch simple. Most children eat lunch quickly so that they can spend more time socializing or \\nplaying with friends. \\n• Pack small portions which can be finished during lunch period. \\n \\nMaking healthy choices \\nAs children grow up, they because more independent about choosing their food. Children can be made \\nhealthful choices by. \\n• Being a role model \\n• Making them plant vegetables or fruit trees (children take pride in eating foods they have growth). \\n• Taking them to fruits and vegetables market.  \\n• Allowing them to plan the menu with the help of food guide pyramid. \\n• Encouraging them to cook simple recipes (they are more likely to eat foods they have prepared). \\n• Pre-portioning can help in preventing over or under eating.  \\nStudy Material'),\n",

Next, a \\nreview of indices for adults and adolescents follows. \\n \\niv) Anthropometric Indices in Adults \\nIn case of adults, Body Mass Index (BMI) is used to assess nutritional status. BMI is a simple \\nindex of weight -to-Height used to classify underweight, overweight and obesity in adults. BMI \\ngives a measure of the body fat based on weight in relation to height and applies to most adult \\nmen and women aged 20 and over. BMI is defined as the weight (in kg) divided by the square of \\nthe Height in meters (kg/m\\n2). \\nBMI = Weight (kg) \\nHeight (m)2 \\nFor example if an adult women weigh's 60 kg and her height is 155 centimeters, then BMI for \\nthe women would be: BMI = 60 /(1.55)\\n2 = 24.97 kg/m2. \\nThe BMI can be interpreted as under: \\n   BMI < 17.0 indicates moderate and severe thinness \\n   BMI < 18.5 indicates underweight \\n   BMI 18.5–24.9 indicates normal weight \\n   BMI ≥ 25.0 indicates overweight \\n    BMI ≥ 30.0 indicates obesity \\n \\n \\nRecent data suggests (NFHS 4, 2015 -16) that 22.9% adult Indian women and 20.2 % adult men \\nare underweight. On the other hand, 20.7% women and 18.9% men are overweight or obese . \\nEvidence suggests that high BMI is associated with diabetes and high risk of cardiovascular \\nmorbidity and mortality. \\niii) Nutritional Indices for Older Children and Adolescent \\nFor children and adolescent, 5 to 19 years of age, BMI is used to assess nutritional status and \\ncalculated the same way as for adults. But here BMI is compared with typical values for other \\nchildren of the same age and sex (WHO Growth Standards 2007). BMI is compared against the \\npercentile for children of the same age and sex. Why? Because, in this group the body fat  \\nchanges with age and also the body fat differs between boys and girls.

       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='C. Biochemical Assessment \\nBiochemical assessment i.e. laboratory tests based on blood and urine can be important indicators \\nof nutritional status. Biochemical assessment deals with measuring the level of essential dietary \\nconstituents (i.e. nutrient concentration, metabolites) in the body fluids (normally blood and urine) \\nwhich is helpful in evaluating the possibility of malnutrition. For example, Anemia is the most \\nwidespread of all the nutritional deficiencies found among individuals in our country. It is  \\nlargely due to iron deficiency. So the measure of the haemoglobin (Hb) in the blood is helpful in \\nevaluating the possibility of iron deficiency. Similarly a measure of the level of iodine in the \\nurine reflects the iodine status in a community. Also stool examination for the presence of ova \\nand/or intestinal parasites gives useful information. \\nThe advantages of using biochemical assessment are that it is useful in detecting early changes in \\nbody metabolism or nutritional status much before the appearance of overt clinical signs and \\nsymptoms. It is precise and accurate. But it can be time consuming and expensive. It requires \\ntrained personnel and facilities. \\n \\nD. Dietary Assessment \\nFrom our study so far it must be clear that diet or food intake is a major life -style factor which \\ninfluences our nutritional status. Dietary assessment, therefore involves reviewing the intake of \\nfood and the nutrients and comparing the amount consumed with reference value to see whether \\ndeficiency or excess is likely. So when a systematic inquiry into the food supplies and food \\nconsumption of individuals and population groups is made, we call it a diet survey. \\nDiet surveys can be undertaken at an individual and/or family/household level. Dietary intake \\ncan be assessed by subjective self report such as food recall, diaries or food frequency \\nquestionnaires. Primarily, there are a wide range of methods used in diet surveys.

Phytate, or phytic \\nacid, is a naturally occurring compou nd found in all plant foods \\nlike beans, grains, nuts, and  seeds.

The early learning component of the ICDS is a significant input for \\nproviding a sound foundation for cumulative lifelong learning and development. It also \\ncontributes to the universalization of primary education, by providing to the child the \\nnecessary preparation for primary schooling and offering substitute care to younger siblings, \\nthus freeing the older ones – especially girls – to attend school. The Non formal pre school \\neducation is provided to the children in the age group of 3 to 6 yrs on all working days of the \\nanganwadi centres.

It is also the period to shape and consolidate healthy eating and life \\nstyle behaviors, thereby preventing the  onset of nutrition related chronic diseases i n womanhood \\nand prevalence of  malnutrition in future generation. Iron deficiency anaemia is the most \\nwidespread micronutrient deficiency affecting the vulnerable groups including adolescent girls  \\nwhich reduces the capacity to learn and work, resulting in l ower productivity and limiting \\neconomic and social development. Anaemia during pregnancy leads to high maternal and neonatal \\nmortality and low birth weight etc. Addressing the health needs of Adolescent Girls will not only \\nlead to a healthier and more prod uctive women force but will also help to break the \\nintergenerational cycle of malnutrition. Within the Human Rights framework established and \\naccepted by the global  community, the rights particularly relevant to adolescents include gender \\nequality, right to education and health (including reproductive and sexual health) and  information \\nand services appropriate to their age, capacities and circumstances.  Definite measures should to be \\ntaken to ensure these rights and also make the girls aware of their duties  and responsibilities.

Care during pregnancy and delivery: The focus of IGMSY is to improve  nutritional and \\nhealth status of pregnant and lactating women across the country  by partly compensating for \\ntheir wage loss and encouraging increased access to  supplementary nutrition under ICDS \\nScheme. \\na) Early Identification and Registration of pregnancy:  Early registration of  pregnancy is \\nessential for availing facilities offered by the health care  services to assess the health and \\nnutritional status of the pregnant woman. It  also helps to screen for complications early in the \\npregnancy. Early identification and registration of pregnancy is being promoted by the  \\nGovernment of India primarily through National Rural Health Mission(NRHM) and Janani \\nSuraksha Yojana (JSY). \\nb) Antenatal Care (ANC): During the ANC at the health centre, vital  milestones of \\npregnancy are noted. Ideally, apart from the ANC at  registration, three ANCs are necessary \\nand are mandated under NRHM.Periodic antenatal check -ups help in early detection, \\nmanagement of complications, timely advice and appropriate referral. This can help improve \\nmaternal and neonatal survival. ANC is a key entry point for a pregnant woman to receive a \\nbroad range of health promotion and preventive health services, including nutritional support \\nand prevention and treatment anaemia and other infectious diseases associated with \\nreproductive health \\nc) Institutional Delivery: One of the accepted strategies for reducing maternal mortality is to \\npromote deliveries at health institutions by skilled personnel  like doctors and nurses. The \\nJanani Suraksha Yojana (JSY ) provides  cash assistance for Institutional Delivery. The \\nbenefits under JSY  are linked to pregnant women getting the delivery conducted in health \\ncentres/ hospitals. [Early initiation of breast feeding and colostrum feeding may also be  \\nensured]. No cash transfer has been envisaged under IGMSY at the time of delivery since it is \\ncovered under JSY. \\nStudy Material'),\n",

Besides increasing the birth weight, \\ntimely intervention will help reduce both Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and Maternal Mortality \\nRate (MMR). It is to ensure that malnutrition doesn’t affect children’s cognitive development \\nor physical growth. The initiative seeks to reduce the level of stunting, undernutrition and low \\nbirth weight by 2% each, and  anaemia by 3%. It aims to reduce stunting f rom 38.4% (NFHS-\\n4) to 25% by 2022.

World \\nHealth Organization (WHO) recognizes the important role of BCC in the achievement of \\nhealth, nutrition and population goals. In this Unit we will focus on what is BCC, the process \\nand the approaches to nutrition education communication. We begin with first defining the \\nvarious terminologies used in the context of nutrition education communication.\\n \\nEducation in nutrition is a necessary part of practical programmes to improve human \\nnutrition. As a student of public nutrition you will come across terms like Behavior Change \\nCommunication (BCC), Information, Education and Communication (IEC) and very commonly \\nnutrition education (NE) used \\nStudy Material'),\n",

What are these terms? Let's define them.  \\nNutrition Education (NE): Nutrition education is a process of persuading people to act in their \\nown best interest for attaining nutritional well -being. It is a process by which beliefs, attitudes, \\nenvironmental influences and understanding about food leads to practices that are sound, \\npractical and consistent with individual needs that will make a maximum contribution to \\nhealth and social well being. \\nInformation, Education and Communication (IEC): IEC is described as a strategy to inform the \\npublic about nutrition/health concerns and attempts to change or reinforce a set of behaviour \\nin a target population regarding the specific problem in a predefined period of  time. \\nBehaviour Change Communication (BCC): BCC is a process of working with individuals, \\nfamilies, communities through different communication methods to promote positive health \\nbehaviour and support  an environment that enables the community to maintain and sustain \\npositive health behaviour. \\nNow that you have gone through the three definitions what do you notice? Yes, BCC, IEC \\nand nutrition education terminologies, all three, are in fact, interchangeable. They all aim at \\ncreating awareness,  motivating people to change behaviors and result in necessary action \\ni.e. persuades people to adopt and sustain desirable nutrition and health practices. \\nDisseminating knowledge provides important information; however, provision of information \\non its own has little effect. Act ion directed at strengthening the skills and capabilities of \\nindividuals to make healthy behaviour choices and change nutrition/health behaviour should \\nbe the objective of any nutrition education communication exercise.  The biggest challenge in \\nnutrition education communication is behaviour change. Behaviour change communication, \\ntherefore, is a process of promoting and sustaining healthy changes in behaviour in \\nindividuals and communities.\\n \\nWith this understanding let us learn about the need, scope of BCC.  \\n \\n \\nStudy Material\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='4  \\nBCC can play a vital role in improving the nutritional status of individuals, families and community \\nmembers if they adopt positive nutrition behavior.

You must have realized that BCC involves working with \\nindividuals, families, communities to develop communication strategies/ activities.  The next \\nsection focuses on the process of behavior change communication. \\n \\nBefore we discuss the process of BCC let us first understand what is meant by the term \\n'communication'. \\n \\nStudy Material\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='6  \\nCommunication simply defined, is the act of transmitting information, ideas and attitudes \\nfrom one person to another such that intended goals are met. Communication is a two way  \\nStudy Material'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='7  \\nprocess wherein the message in the form of an idea, thought, feeling, opinion is transmitted \\nbetween two or more persons with the intent of creating a shared understanding.  \\nFigure 1 illustrates the communication process. If you look at the figure carefully you would \\nidentify four components in communication process. These include -  SENDER, RECEIVER, \\nMESSAGE and the FEEDBACK. \\n \\nFigure 1: The communication process \\n \\nLet us review these four components in the context of behaviour change communication: \\n \\n1. The BCC process begins with the conceptualization of an idea by the SOURCE.  In  this \\nprocess the sender or communicator comm unicates the message. The communicator \\ncan be any source, you or any other nutrition/health expert or health worker or it can be \\nany medium/channel such as audio visual aid like the television, radio etc. \\n2. The second component is the Message. Message consists of what is actually \\ncommunicated. Message can be oral, written, non verbal such as body gesture, sound \\netc. or picture or any other signal that we use to get our idea across for motivation or \\nbehavior change. An example of a written message in nutri tion education communication \\ncould be: \"Breast milk is the best food for the Infant\". Remember, the message should be \\nbrief, logical, persuasive, coherent i.e. clearly address the problem/issue to be dealt with. \\n3. The third component is the RECEIVER. Rec eiver is the person/population (audience) for \\nwhom the message is intended or targeted. It can be an individual or a vulnerable group \\nor a community as a whole with whom we communicate  for  change  in  behavior. For \\nexample in an infant and child feeding nutrition communication programme the primary \\naudience could be the  mothers,  grandmothers  or  older siblings whoever is the \\ncaretakers of children, who need to be informed. \\nStudy Material'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='8  \\nBEHAVIOUR CHANGE COMMUNICATION METHODS \\n4. The last component is FEEDBACK. Feedback is defined as the response or \\ninformation provided as a result of an event, the event in this case being the \\ntransmission of information. Feedback occurs when the receiver receives the message \\nfrom a source. The receiver listens, reads or observes non verbal signals or visual \\ninformation and send non verbal or verbal feedback to the source who can than \\nmodify the message in response to the feedback to make it more persuasive to the \\nreceiver. So you may have noticed that feedback is a two way process.\\n \\n \\n \\nIt would be worth remembering here that behavior change communication process will be \\neffective only and only if all the four components highlighted above are present. \\n \\nIn order to facilitate the process of communication we  need  communication  skills.  These skills \\nare gained through knowledge and practice of the methods of communication. The messages can \\nbe conveyed through a variety  of  communication  methods.  These  are  described in the next  \\nsection. \\nInformation, education and communication (IEC) approaches are used to reach the target \\naudience. There are a wide variety of methods/media that can be  used  to  disseminate \\nmessages, information to the people. The correct choice of method is an essential aspect of \\ncommunication in nutrition and health education. Off course which method  to  use  will  depend \\non who the target audience is i.e. are we reaching out to rural population or urban population or to \\nschool children or to general public? Each audience has their own charact eristics (i.e. age, \\nexperiences, education level, exposure to media, reading, writing, listening skills, ownership of \\nradio/TV etc.). Also the cost factor will influence the use of \\nmethod/media. \\nPrimarily the behaviour change communication methods can be categorized as: \\n\\uf0b7 Interpersonal Communication methods: include all those forms of communication involving \\ndirect interaction between the source and the receiver. Examples of interpersonal \\ncommunication methods  include:  interviews,  individual  discussions, face to face \\ncounseling or group discussions, community meetings, events etc. \\n\\uf0b7 Mass communication media: Mass communication comprises techniques by which \\nspecialized groups employ technological devices such as press, radio, television audio \\nvisuals aids like films, documentaries etc. to disseminate content, information to large \\nStudy Material'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='9  \\nheterogeneous and widely dispersed audience, and \\nStudy Material'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='1\\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Traditional Communication methods: the non electronic form of communication employing \\nvocal, verbal, musical and visual folk art form, transmitted from an individual or a group of \\nindividual from one generation to another. Examples include folk music and dance, \\npuppetry, storytelling etc.  These  are  indigenous  modes and have served t he society as \\na  medium  of communication since ages.  They were used  for moral, religious, socio-\\npolitical communication earlier but in the recent past, they  are being used for educational \\npurposes particularly in nutrition and health education. \\n \\nRefer to Figure 2 which illustrates thee different methods of communication. \\nFigure 2: Behaviour change communication methods \\n \\n \\nThe most successful attempt to change nutrition/health habits have been based mainly on \\ninterpersonal communication used in conjunction with other methods. Interpersonal \\ncommunication can take place as an individual approach or group approach. Under \\nindividual approach one -to-one counseling or home visit or one- to-one interview, \\ntelephone contact can take place. For example when a caregiver say a mother visits the \\nhospital or a health facility, the nutrition health educator listens to the caregiver’s \\nproblems and help her find solutions to her problems. Similarly, group discussion method \\nStudy Material'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='1\\n \\n \\ninvolves face-to-face interaction with a group of people. \\nStudy Material'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': None}, page_content='1\\n \\n \\nMass media implies that we can reach large number of people at a time \\nthrough the means of communications  employed  through  this  \\napproach. In this method the Source and the Receiver  are  never  in \\ndirect contact. The interaction between source and receiver is mediated \\nthrough the visual image (poster, flip chart, video, TV etc.), print (news \\npaper, magazines), verbal (radio, etc.) or by a combination of these \\nelements. Mass media can be very effective in creating awareness and \\ninterest in new ideas among general population.  It  provides  a  rapid \\nway to reach a large audience without using a lot of  manpower.  It \\nmakes good use of scarce recourses. It not only informs but it also \\nappropriate to create or reinforce change and motivates people. But the \\nuse of mass media can be limiting for large n diverse audience. The \\nproblems, needs may differ from one region to region or from people to \\npeople. Hence, it may be difficult to make the  message appropriate to  \\nthe special situation or need of the people. Mass media alone cannot \\npersuade people to change deep -rooted attitudes or  learn  complex  \\nskills. We need to combine it with interpersonal communication also \\nindividual feedback is difficult to obtain. \\n  \\n \\nLectures, demonstrations, meetings, community events are all  group  \\ndiscussion methods. Theories about behavior change emphasize that people \\ndevelop confidence and are willing to perform a new  behaviour   when they  \\ncan observe others in their community doing the same. Therefore, role play, \\ndrama can build people’s confidence in performing a new practice. \\n \\nThe main advantage of using interpersonal communication method is that it is \\npossible to contact specific individuals or groups of individuals and make the \\nadvice relevant to their social, health needs and develop problem solving skills \\nand encourage  community participation.  But  the method has few limitations  \\nas the approach can be slow for spreading information in a population as it \\nwould require travelling to different communities and need to mobilize large \\nnumber of health/nutrition workers. Further in large groups it may be difficult  \\nto have feedback and discussions. \\nLecture cum Discussion \\n \\nDemonstration \\n \\nRole Play \\nNewspape\\n \\nFlip Chart \\nTV Broadcast Banner \\nLeaflet Poster \\nStudy Material'),\n",

So you can appreciate how methods can help  \\nchange behavior. Remember, posters, charts, leaflets and other visual aids can provide \\ninformation. Stories, dramas, plays can present role models for behavior  change; discussions \\nprovide opportunities to provide for solving problems by two way interaction and feedbacks. \\nRadio, TV and other audio video aids can remind people about action. So use the \\ncommunication methods judiciously. \\n \\nAlso remember that the effectiveness of each method is specific to the audience or target \\ngroup. For example, using m ass media as a  means to reach out to urban  population  is  \\nmost effective. Similarly, while using interpersonal communication with rural women, \\ndemonstrations, charts, models may be more effective. It is always better to use a multi - \\nmedia combination i.e. use several methods of communication in such a way that each \\none of them reinforces the \\nparticular method alone. \\nother and their collective impact is greater than using \\nTraditional media appeals at personal and intimate  level.  It can be  available \\nat very low cost. It is flexible in adopting themes specific to nutrition/health \\neducation. But traditional media is cultural specific and only people from a \\nparticular culture; region can identify the context and understand the \\n \\nTraditional methods can be folk music, ballad forms of folk and puppetry. \\nSome common forms of ballad style include Barrakatha  (from Andhra \\nPradesh, Jugani and Vaar (Punjab). Adopting and composing folk songs, \\nfolktales and stories in local languages related to a particular problem can \\nhelp people understand the issue. For example folktale relating to \\nanaemia, can be designed on how misunderstanding the cause of \\nanaemia led to the death of an anemic mother during child birth or the \\ndeath of an anaemic child. Further, Puppetry too fascinates people of all \\nages, but children in particular.

    "system_prompt=(\"You are NutriBot, an expert nutrition assistant powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. Your goal is to provide accurate, personalized, and practical nutrition suggestions based on the user's query and relevant nutritional information retrieved from a vector database. Follow these steps:\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"1. **Retrieve and Analyze Context**: Use the provided context from the vector store, which contains nutritional guidelines, food data, dietary restrictions, and healthy recipes. Ensure all suggestions align with evidence-based nutritional science.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"2. **Understand the User’s Query**: Interpret the user’s input, which may include dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, keto), health goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, managing diabetes), allergies, cultural or religious dietary restrictions, or specific questions about foods, meals, or nutrients.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"3. **Personalize the Response**: Tailor your suggestions to the user’s specific needs, preferences, and constraints. If the user provides details like age, weight, activity level, or medical conditions, incorporate these into your recommendations. If details are missing, ask clarifying questions politely to refine your suggestions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"4. **Provide Actionable Suggestions**: Offer clear, practical advice, such as specific meal ideas, portion sizes, nutrient breakdowns, or simple recipes. Include tips for preparation or substitutions if relevant. Ensure suggestions are realistic and accessible based on common ingredients and cooking skills.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"5. **Maintain a Professional and Friendly Tone**: Communicate in a clear, concise, and encouraging manner, as if you’re a trusted nutritionist. Avoid overly technical jargon unless the user requests it, and ensure your tone is supportive and non-judgmental.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"6. **Handle Edge Cases**: If the user’s query is vague, incomplete, or contains conflicting information, ask clarifying questions or make reasonable assumptions based on general health guidelines. If the retrieved context is insufficient, rely on general nutritional knowledge but acknowledge any limitations.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"7. **Ensure Safety and Accuracy**: Do not suggest foods or diets that could harm the user based on their stated allergies, medical conditions, or restrictions. If a query involves a medical condition requiring professional advice, recommend consulting a healthcare provider.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Example Query: “I’m a 30-year-old vegetarian looking to gain muscle. I’m allergic to nuts. Suggest a high-protein dinner.”\"\n",
    "\"Example Response: Based on your vegetarian diet and nut allergy, I recommend a high-protein dinner of lentil and chickpea curry with quinoa. Lentils and chickpeas provide approximately 15g of protein per cup, and quinoa adds about 8g per cup. Combine 1 cup cooked lentils, 1 cup chickpeas, spinach, and tomatoes in a curry sauce (use coconut milk for creaminess, avoiding nut-based ingredients). Serve with 1 cup cooked quinoa. This meal offers roughly 30g of protein and is rich in fiber and iron. Would you like a detailed recipe or additional meal ideas?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Use the retrieved context: {context}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"If clarification is needed, ask: Could you share any dietary restrictions, allergies, health goals, or specific preferences (e.g., vegan, low-carb, cultural preferences)?\")"
